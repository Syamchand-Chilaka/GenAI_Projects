So you don\\'t really want to be stuck looking at datapoints one at a time.\\nLuckily, LangSmith has a set of tools to help with observability in production.Monitoring‚ÄãIf you click on the Monitor tab in a project, you will see a series of monitoring charts.\\nHere we track lots of LLM specific statistics - number of traces, feedback, time-to-first-token, etc.\\nYou can view these over time across a few different time bins.A/B Testing‚ÄãnoteGroup-by functionality for A/B testing requires at least 2 different values to exist for a given metadata key.You can also use this tab to perform a version of A/B Testing.\\nIn the previous tutorial we starting tracking a few different metadata attributes - one of which was llm.\\nWe can group the monitoring charts by ANY metadata attribute, and instantly get grouped charts over time.\\nThis allows us to experiment with different LLMs (or prompts, or other) and track their performance over time.In order to do this, we just need to click on the Metadata button at the top.\\nThis will give us a drop down of options to choose from to group by:Once we select this, we will start to see charts grouped by this attribute:Drilldown‚ÄãOne of the awesome abilities that LangSmith provides is the ability to easily drilldown into datapoints that you identify\\nas problematic while looking at monitoring charts.\\nIn order to do this, you can simply hover over a datapoint in the monitoring chart.\\nWhen you do this, you will be able to click the datapoint.\\nThis will lead you back to the runs table with a filtered view:Conclusion‚ÄãIn this tutorial you saw how to set up your LLM application with best-in-class observability.\\nNo matter what stage your application is in, you will still benefit from observability.If you have more in-depth questions about observability, check out the how-to section for guides on topics like testing, prompt management, and more.Observability is not the only thing LangSmith can help with!\\nIt can also help with evaluation, optimization, and more!\\nCheck out the other tutorials to see how to get started with those.Was this page helpful?You can leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousOptimize tracing spend on LangSmithNextEvaluate your LLM applicationPrototypingSet up your environmentTrace your LLM callsTrace the whole chainTrace the retrieval stepBeta TestingCollecting FeedbackLogging MetadataProductionMonitoringA/B TestingDrilldownConclusionCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogLangChain Python DocsLangChain JS/TS DocsCopyright ¬© 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n')]"

       "'You\\'re right to ask! It seems like you\\'re looking for an even deeper dive into the newest trends. \\n\\nHere are some cutting-edge developments in data science that are pushing the boundaries even further:\\n\\n**1.  Foundation Models & Prompt Engineering:**\\n\\n* **Beyond Text:** While LLMs like GPT-3 are impressive, research is expanding to foundation models that handle other data types like images (DALL-E 2), audio (Jukebox), and even scientific data.\\n* **Fine-tuning for Specificity:**  The ability to \"fine-tune\" these massive models for specific tasks (like medical diagnosis or code generation) is becoming increasingly sophisticated.\\n* **Prompt Engineering as an Art:**  Crafting effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from foundation models is emerging as a crucial skill, requiring creativity and understanding of model capabilities.\\n\\n**2.  Causal Inference & Counterfactual Reasoning:**\\n\\n* **Going Beyond Correlation:**  Traditional machine learning often reveals correlations but struggles to establish causation. New methods are being developed to better understand cause-and-effect relationships in data.\\n* **What If? Scenarios:**  Causal inference enables us to explore \"counterfactual\" scenarios – what would have happened if a certain event hadn\\'t occurred? This has applications in policy analysis, healthcare, and decision-making.\\n\\n**3.  AutoML & Democratization of Data Science:**\\n\\n* **AI for Building AI:** AutoML tools are automating many aspects of the data science pipeline, from feature engineering to model selection, making it more accessible to people without deep technical expertise.\\n* **No-Code/Low-Code Platforms:**  Platforms are emerging that allow users to build data-driven applications with minimal or no coding, further democratizing access to data science capabilities.\\n\\n**4.  Data Science for Sustainability:**\\n\\n* **Climate Modeling & Prediction:**  Data science is playing a crucial role in understanding and mitigating climate change, from analyzing weather patterns to optimizing energy consumption.\\n* **Environmental Monitoring & Conservation:**  Sensors and data analysis are being used to track deforestation, pollution levels, and other environmental indicators, informing conservation efforts.\\n\\n**5.  The Rise of Explainable AI (XAI):**\\n\\n* **Trust & Transparency:**  As AI systems become more powerful, understanding how they make decisions is crucial for building trust and ensuring responsible use. \\n* **New Techniques & Visualizations:**  Researchers are developing novel methods to explain AI models in a way that is both accurate and understandable to humans.\\n\\n**Staying Ahead of the Curve:**\\n\\nThe field of data science is constantly evolving. To stay informed about the latest developments, consider:\\n\\n* **Following Industry Blogs and Publications:**  Websites like Towards Data Science, KDnuggets, and Analytics Vidhya offer insightful articles and news.\\n* **Attending Conferences and Workshops:**  Events like NeurIPS, ICML, and KDD bring together leading researchers and practitioners.\\n* **Engaging with Online Communities:**  Platforms like Reddit\\'s r/datascience and Stack Overflow provide opportunities to learn from and connect with other data scientists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

Data science is like having a super-powered detective team that can sift through all that information and find hidden clues.\\n\\nHere's what they do:\\n\\n* **Gather Clues:** They collect data from everywhere – flight schedules, ticket sales, customer surveys, even social media posts about your airline.\\n* **Solve the Puzzle:**  They use math, statistics, and computer programs to spot patterns and trends in the data. Maybe they find that people flying on Tuesdays book cheaper tickets, or that delays cause a lot of complaints.\\n* **Make Predictions:** Based on the patterns, they can predict things like how many people will book flights next month, which routes are most profitable, or when a plane is likely to be delayed.\\n* **Give Advice:** They present their findings to the airline in a way that's easy to understand. This helps the airline make better decisions, like adjusting ticket prices, scheduling flights more efficiently, or improving customer service.\\n\\n**So, Data Science is basically using smart tools and techniques to find valuable information hidden in lots and lots of data.** \\n\\nIt helps businesses like airlines (and many others!) make better decisions, save money, and improve things for their customers.\\n\""

The lack of diligence can\\nlead to technical debt, scope creep and misaligned objectives, model misuse and failures, and\\nexpensive consequences. Engineering systems, on the other hand, follow well-deﬁned processes\\nand testing standards to streamline development for high-quality, reliable results. The extreme is\\nspacecraft systems, where mission critical measures and robustness are ingrained in the development\\nprocess. Drawing on experience in both spacecraft engineering and ML (from research through\\nproduct across domain areas), we have developed a proven systems engineering approach for machine\\nlearning development and deployment. Our Machine Learning Technology Readiness Levels (MLTRL)\\nframework deﬁnes a principled process to ensure robust, reliable, and responsible systems while\\nbeing streamlined for ML workﬂows, including key distinctions from traditional software engineering.\\nEven more, MLTRL deﬁnes a lingua franca for people across teams and organizations to work\\ncollaboratively on artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Here we describe the\\nframework and elucidate it with several real world use-cases of developing ML methods from basic\\nresearch through productization and deployment, in areas such as medical diagnostics, consumer\\ncomputer vision, satellite imagery, and particle physics.\\nKeywords: Machine Learning; Systems Engineering; Data Management; Medical AI; Space Sciences\\nIntroduction\\nThe accelerating use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies in systems of software,\\nhardware, data, and people introduces vulnerabilities and risks due to dynamic and unreliable behaviors; fundamentally,\\nML systems learn from data, introducing known and unknown challenges in how these systems behave and interact with\\ntheir environment. Currently the approach to building AI technologies is siloed: models and algorithms are developed\\nin testbeds isolated from real-world environments, and without the context of larger systems or broader products they’ll\\nbe integrated within for deployment. A main concern is models are typically trained and tested on only a handful of\\ncurated datasets, without measures and safeguards for future scenarios, and oblivious of the downstream tasks and\\nusers. Even more, models and algorithms are often integrated into a software stack without regard for the inherent\\nstochasticity –for instance, the massive effect random seeds have on deep reinforcement learning model performance\\n[1] – and failure modes of the ML components, which can be dangerously hidden in layers of software and abstraction.\\nOther domains of engineering, such as civil and aerospace, follow well-deﬁned processes and testing standards to\\nstreamline development for high-quality, reliable results.

It is no surprise that TRL is standard process and parlance in NASA[ 3] and\\nDARPA[4].\\nFor a spaceﬂight project there are several deﬁned phases, from pre-concept to prototyping to deployed operations to\\nend-of-life, each with a series of exacting development cycles and reviews. This is in stark contrast to common machine\\nlearning and software workﬂows, which promote quick iteration, rapid deployment, and simple linear progressions. Yet\\nthe NASA technology readiness process for spacecraft systems is overkill; we need robust ML technologies integrated\\nwith larger systems of software, hardware, data, and humans, but not necessarily for missions to Mars. We aim to bring\\nsystems engineering to AI and ML by deﬁning and putting into action a lean Machine Learning Technology Readiness\\nLevels (MLTRL) framework. We draw on decades of AI and ML development, from research through production,\\nacross domains and diverse data scenarios: for example, computer vision in medical diagnostics and consumer apps,\\nautomation in self-driving vehicles and factory robotics, tools for scientiﬁc discovery and causal inference, streaming\\ntime-series in predictive maintenance and ﬁnance.\\nIn this paper we deﬁne our framework for developing and deploying robust, reliable, and responsible ML and data\\nsystems, with several real test cases of advancing models and algorithms from R&D through productization and\\ndeployment, including essential data considerations. Additionally, MLTRL prioritizes the role of AI ethics and\\nfairness, and our systems AI approach can help curb the large societal issues that can result from poorly deployed and\\nmaintained AI and ML technologies, such as the automation of systemic human bias, denial of individual autonomy,\\nand unjustiﬁable outcomes (see the Alan Turing Institute Report on Ethical AI [5]). The adoption and proliferation of\\nMLTRL provides a common nomenclature and metric across teams and industries. The standardization of MLTRL\\nacross the AI industry should help teams and organizations develop principled, safe, and trusted technologies.\\nFigure 1: MLTRL spans research through prototyping, productization, and deployment. Most ML workﬂows prescribe\\nan isolated, linear process of data processing, training, testing, and serving a model [ 6].

Lastly, to emphasize the importance of data tasks in ML, from data curation [ 8] to data governance [ 9], we\\nstate several important data considerations at each MLTRL level.\\nMACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS\\nThe levels are brieﬂy deﬁned as follows and in Figure 1, and elucidated with real-world examples later.\\nLevel 0 - First Principles This is a stage for greenﬁeld AI research, initiated with a novel idea, guiding question, or\\npoking at a problem from new angles. The work mainly consists of literature review, building mathematical foundations,\\nwhite-boarding concepts and algorithms, and building an understanding of the data – for work in theoretical AI and ML,\\nhowever, there will not yet be data to work with (for example, a novel algorithm for Bayesian optimization[ 10], which\\ncould eventually be used for many domains and datasets). The outcome of Level 0 is a set of concrete ideas with sound\\nmathematical formulation, to pursue through low-level experimentation in the next stage. When relevant, this level\\nexpects conclusions about data readiness, including strategies for getting the data to be suitable for the speciﬁc ML task.\\nTo graduate, the basic principles, hypotheses, data readiness, and research plans need to be stated, referencing relevant\\nliterature. With graduation, a TRL Card should be started to succinctly document the methods and insights thus far –\\nthis key MLTRL deliverable is detailed in the Methods section and Figure 3.\\nLevel 0 data – Not a hard requirement at this stage because this is largely theoretical machine learning. That being said,\\ndata availability needs to be considered for deﬁning any research project to move past theory.\\nLevel 0 review – The reviewer here is solely the lead of the research lab or team, for instance a PhD supervisor. We\\nassess hypotheses and explorations for mathematical validity and potential novelty or utility, not necessarily code nor\\nend-to-end experiment results.\\nLevel 1 - Goal-Oriented Research To progress from basic principles to practical use, we design and run low-level\\nexperiments to analyze speciﬁc model or algorithm properties (rather than end-to-end runs for a performance benchmark\\nscore). This involves collection and processing of sample data to train and evaluate the model. This sample data need\\nnot be the full data; it may be a smaller sample that is currently available or more convenient to collect. In some\\ncases it may sufﬁce to use synthetic data as the representative sample – in the medical domain, for example, acquiring\\ndatasets can take many months due to security and privacy constraints, so generating sample data can mitigate this\\nblocker from early ML development. Further, working with the sample data provides a blueprint for the data collection\\nand processing pipeline (including answering whether it is even possible to collect all necessary data), that can be\\nscaled up for the for the next steps. The experiments, good results or not, and mathematical foundations need to pass a\\nreview process with fellow researchers before graduating to Level 2. The application is still speculative, but through\\ncomparison studies and analyses we start to understand if/how/where the technology offers potential improvements and\\nutility. Code is research-caliber : The aim here is to be quick and dirty, moving fast through iterations of experiments.\\nHacky code is okay, and full test coverage is actually discouraged, as long as the overall codebase is organized and\\nmaintainable. It is important to start semantic versioning practices early in the project lifecycle, which should cover\\ncode, models, anddatasets. This is crucial for retrospectives and reproducibility, issues with which can be costly and\\nsevere at later stages. This versioning information and additional progress should be reported on the TRL Card (see for\\nexample Figure 3).\\nLevel 1 data – At minimum we work with sample data that is representative of downstream real datasets, which can be\\na subset of real data, synthetic data, or both. Beyond driving low-level ML experiments, the sample data forces us to\\nconsider data acquisition and processing strategies at an early stage before it becomes a blocker later.\\nLevel 1 review – The panel for this gated review is entirely members of the research team, reviewing for scientiﬁc rigor\\nin early experimentation, and pointing to important concepts and prior work from their respective areas of expertise.\\nThere may be several iterations of feedback and additional experiments.\\nLevel 2 - Proof of Principle (PoP) Development Active R&D is initiated, mainly by developing and running in\\ntestbeds : simulated environments and/or simulated data that closely matches the conditions and data of real scenarios –\\nnote these are driven by model-speciﬁc technical goals, not necessarily application or product goals (yet). An important\\ndeliverable at this stage is the formal research requirements document (with well-speciﬁed veriﬁcation and validation\\n(V&V) steps)iv. Here is one of several key decision points in the broader process: The R&D team considers several\\npaths forward and sets the course: (A) prototype development towards Level 3, (B) continued R&D for longer-term\\nivArequirement is a singular documented physical or functional need that a particular design, product, or process aims to satisfy.\\nRequirements aim to specify all stakeholders’ needs while not specifying a speciﬁc solution. Deﬁnitions are incomplete without\\n3'),\n",

We ﬁnd the culmination of this stage is often\\na bifurcation: some work moves to applied AI, while some circles back for more research. This common MLTRL cycle\\nis an instance of the non-monotonic discovery switchback mechanism (detailed in the Methods section).\\nLevel 2 data – Datasets at this stage may include publicly available benchmark datasets, semi-simulated data based\\non the data sample in Level 1, or fully simulated data based on certain assumptions about the potential deployment\\nenvironments. The data should allow researchers to characterize model properties, and highlight corner cases or\\nboundary conditions, in order to justify the utility of continuing R&D on the model.\\nLevel 2 review – To graduate from the PoP stage, the technology needs to satisfy research claims made in previous\\nstages (brought to be bare by the aforementioned PoP data in both quantitative and qualitative ways) with the analyses\\nwell-documented and reproducible.\\nLevel 3 - System Development Here we have checkpoints that push code development towards interoperability,\\nreliability, maintainability, extensibility, and scalability. Code becomes prototype-caliber : A signiﬁcant step up from\\nresearch code in robustness and cleanliness. This needs to be well-designed, well-architected for dataﬂow and interfaces,\\ngenerally covered by unit and integration tests, meet team style standards, and sufﬁciently-documented. Note the\\nprogrammers’ mentality remains that this code will someday be refactored/scrapped for productization; prototype code\\nis relatively primitive with regard to efﬁciency and reliability of the eventual system. With the transition to Level 4 and\\nproof-of-concept mode, the working group should evolve to include product engineering to help deﬁne service-level\\nagreements and objectives (SLAs and SLOs) of the eventual production system.\\nLevel 3 data – For the most part consistent with Level 2; in general, the previous level review can elucidate potential\\ngaps in data coverage and robustness to be addressed in the subsequent level. However, for test suites developed at this\\nstage, it is useful to deﬁne dedicated subsets of the experiment data as default testing sources, as well as setup mock\\ndata for speciﬁc functionalities and scenarios to be tested.\\nLevel 3 review – Teammates from applied AI and engineering are brought into the review to focus on sound software\\npractices, interfaces and documentation for future development, and version control for models and datasets. There are\\nlikely domain- or organization-speciﬁc data management considerations going forward that this review should point out\\n– e.g. standards for data tracking and compliance in healthcare [11].\\nLevel 4 - Proof of Concept (PoC) Development This stage is the seed of application-driven development; for many\\norganizations this is the ﬁrst touch-point with product managers and stakeholders beyond the R&D group. Thus TRL\\nCards and requirements documentation are instrumental in communicating the project status and onboarding new\\npeople. The aim is to demonstrate the technology in a real scenario: quick proof-of-concept examples are developed to\\nexplore candidate application areas and communicate the quantitative and qualitative results. It is essential to use real\\nand representative data for these potential applications. Thus data engineering for the PoC largely involves scaling up\\nthe data collection and processing from Level 1, which may include collecting new data or processing all available data\\nusing scaled experiment pipelines from Level 3. In some scenarios there will new datasets brought in for the PoC, for\\nexample, from an external research partner as a means of validation. Hand-in-hand with the evolution from sample to\\nreal data, the experiment metrics should evolve from ML research to the applied setting: proof-of-concept evaluations\\nshould quantify model and algorithm performance (e.g., precision and recall and various data splits), computational\\ncosts (e.g., CPU vs GPU runtimes), and also metrics that are more relevant to the eventual end-user (e.g., number\\nof false positives in the top-N predictions of a recommender system). We ﬁnd this PoC exploration reveals speciﬁc\\ndifferences between clean and controlled research data versus noisy and stochastic real-world data. The issues can\\nbe readily identiﬁed because of the well-deﬁned distinctions between those development stages in MLTRL, and then\\ntargeted for further development.\\nAI ethics processes vary across organizations, but all should engage in ethics conversations at this stage, including ethics\\nof data collection, and potential of any harm or discriminatory impacts due to the model (as the AI capabilities and\\ndatasets are known). MLTRL requires ethics considerations to be reported on TRL Cards at all stages, which generally\\nlink to an extended ethics checklist. The key decision point here is to push onward with application development or not.\\nIt is common to pause projects that pass Level 4 review, waiting for a better time to dedicate resources, and/or pull the\\ntechnology into a different project.\\nLevel 4 data – Unlike the previous stages, having real-world and representative data is critical for the PoC; even with\\nmethods for verifying that data distributions in synthetic data reliably mirror those of real data [], sufﬁcient conﬁdence\\nin the technology must be achieved with real-world data of the use-case. Further, one must consider how to obtain\\ncorresponding measures for veriﬁcation and validation (V&V). Veriﬁcation: Are we building the product right? Validation: Are we\\nbuilding the right product?\\n4'),\n",

The review also evaluates security and privacy considerations – deﬁning these in\\nthe requirements document with risk quantiﬁcation is a useful mechanism for mitigating potential issues (discussed\\nfurther in the Methods section).\\nLevel 5 - Machine Learning “Capability” At this stage the technology is more than an isolated model or algorithm,\\nit is a speciﬁc capability . For instance, producing depth images from stereo vision sensors on a mobile robot is a\\nreal-world capability beyond the isolated ML technique of self-supervised learning for RGB stereo disparity estimation.\\nIn many organizations this represents a technology transition or handoff from R&D to productization. MLTRL\\nmakes this transition explicit, evolving the requisite work, guiding documentation, objectives and metrics, and team;\\nindeed, without MLTRL it is common for this stage to be erroneously leaped completely, as shown in Figure 2. An\\ninterdisciplinary working group is deﬁned, as we start developing the technology in the context of a larger real-world\\nprocess – i.e., transitioning the model or algorithm from an isolated solution to a module of a larger application. Just as\\nthe ML technology should no longer be owned entirely by ML experts, steps have been taken to share the technology\\nwith others in the organization via demos, example scripts, and/or an API; the knowledge and expertise cannot remain\\nwithin the R&D team, let alone an individual ML developer. Graduation from Level 5 should be difﬁcult, as it signiﬁes\\nthe dedication of resources to push this ML technology through productization. This transition is a common challenge\\nin deep-tech, sometimes referred to as “the valley of death” because project managers and decision-makers struggle\\nto allocate resources and align technology roadmaps to effectively move to Level 6, 7 and onward. MLTRL directly\\naddresses this challenge by stepping through the technology transition or handoff explicitly.\\nLevel 5 data – For the most part consistent with Level 4. However, considerations need to be taken for scaling of data\\npipelines: there will soon be more engineers accessing the existing data and adding more, and the data will be getting\\nmuch more use, including automated testing in later levels. With this scaling can come challenges with data governance.\\nThe data pipelines likely do not mirror the structure of the teams or broader organization. This can result in data silos,\\nduplications, unclear responsibilities, and missing control of data over its entire lifecycle. These challenges and several\\napproaches to data governance (planning and control, organizational, and risk-based) are detailed in Janssen et al. [9].\\nLevel 5 review – The veriﬁcation and validation (V&V) measures and steps deﬁned in earlier R&D stages (namely\\nLevel 2) must all be completed by now, and the product-driven requirements (and corresponding V&V) are drafted at\\nthis stage. We thoroughly review them here, and make sure there is stakeholder alignment (at the ﬁrst possible step of\\nproductization, well ahead of deployment).\\nLevel 6 - Application Development The main work here is signiﬁcant software engineering to bring the code up to\\nproduct-caliber : This code will be deployed to users and thus needs to follow precise speciﬁcations, have comprehensive\\ntest coverage, well-deﬁned APIs, etc. The resulting ML modules should be robustiﬁed towards one or more target\\nuse-cases. If those target use-cases call for model explanations, the methods need to be built and validated alongside\\nthe ML model, and tested for their efﬁcacy in faithfully interpreting the model’s decisions – crucially, this needs to be\\nin the context of downstream tasks and the end-users, as there is often a gap between ML explainability that serves\\nML engineers rather than external stakeholders[ 12]. Similarly, we need to develop the ML modules with known data\\nchallenges in mind, speciﬁcally to check the robustness of the model (and broader pipeline) to changes in the data\\ndistribution between development and deployment.\\nThe deployment setting(s) should be addressed thoroughly in the product requirements document, as ML serving (or\\ndeploying) is an overloaded term that needs careful consideration. First, there are two main types: internal, as APIs\\nfor experiments and other usage mainly by data science and ML teams, and external, meaning an ML model that\\nis embedded or consumed within a real application with real users. The serving constraints vary signiﬁcantly when\\nconsidering cloud deployment vs on-premise or hybrid, batch or streaming, open-source solution or containerized\\nexecutable, etc. Even more, the data at deployment may be limited due to compliance, or we may only have access to\\nencrypted data sources, some of which may only be accessible locally – these scenarios may call for advanced ML\\napproaches such as federated learning[ 13] and other privacy-oriented ML[ 14]. And depending on the application, an\\nML model may not be deployable without restrictions; this typically means being embedded in a rules engine workﬂow\\nwhere the ML model acts like an advisor that discovers edge cases in rules. These deployment factors are hardly\\nconsidered in model and algorithm development despite signiﬁcant inﬂuence on modeling and algorithmic choices;\\nthat said, hardware choices typically are considered early on, such as GPU versus edge devices. It is crucial to make\\nthese systems decisions at Level 6–not too early that serving scenarios and requirements are uncertain, and not too late\\n5'),\n",

This marks a key\\ndecision for the project lifecycle, as this expensive ML deployment risk is common without MLTRL (see Figure 2).\\nLevel 6 data – Additional data should be collected and operationalized at this stage towards robustifying the ML\\nmodels, algorithms, and surrounding components. These include adversarial examples to check local robustness [ 15],\\nsemantically-equivalent perturbations to check consistency of the model with respect to domain assumptions [16, 17],\\nand collecting data from different sources and checking how well the trained model generalizes to them. These\\nconsiderations are even more vital in the challenging deployment domains mentioned above with limited data access.\\nLevel 6 review – Focus is on the code quality, the set of newly deﬁned product requirements, system SLA and SLO\\nrequirements, data pipelines spec, and an AI ethics revisit now that we are closer to a real-world use-case.

When integrating ML modules into larger systems, a codiﬁed list of metamorphic\\nrelations[18] can provide valuable veriﬁcation and validation measures and steps.\\n•Data intervention tests that seek data bugs at various points in the pipelines, downstream to measure the\\npotential effects of data processing and ML on consumers or users of that data, as well as upstream at data\\ningestion or creation. Rather than using model performance as a proxy for data quality, it is crucial to use\\nintervention tests that instead catch data errors with mechanisms speciﬁc to data validation.\\nThese tests in particular help mitigate underspeciﬁcation in ML pipelines, a key obstacle to reliably training models that\\nbehave as expected in deployment[ 19]. On the note of reliability, it is important that quality assurance engineers (QA)\\nplay a key role here and through Level 9, overseeing data processes to ensure privacy and security, and covering audits\\nfor downstream accountability of AI methods.\\nLevel 7 data – In addition to the data for test suites discussed above, this level calls for QA to prioritize data governance :\\nhow data is obtained, managed, used, and secured by the organization. This was earlier suggested in level 5 (in order to\\npreempt related technical debt), and essential here at the main junction for integration, which may create additional\\ngovernance challenges in light of downstream effects and consumers.\\nLevel 7 review – The review should focus on the data pipelines and test suites; a scorecard like the ML Testing\\nRubric[ 20] is useful. The group should also emphasize ethical considerations at this stage, as they may be more\\nadequately addressed now (where there are many test suites put into place) rather than close to shipping later.\\nLevel 8 - Flight-ready The technology is demonstrated to work in its ﬁnal form and under expected conditions.\\nThere should be additional tests implemented at this stage covering deployment aspects, notably A/B tests, blue/green\\ndeployment tests, shadow testing, and canary testing, which enable proactive and gradual testing for changing ML\\nmethods and data.

For instance, performance degradation can be hidden\\nand critical, and feature improvements often bring unintended consequences and constraints. Thus at this level, the\\nfocus is on maintenance engineering–i.e., methods and pipelines for ML monitoring and updating. Monitoring for data\\nquality, concept drift, and data drift is crucial; no AI system without thorough tests for these can reliably be deployed.\\nBy the same token there must be automated evaluation and reporting – if actuals[ 21] are available, continuous evaluation\\nshould be enabled, but in many cases actuals come with a delay, so it is essential to record model outputs to allow for\\nefﬁcient evaluation after the fact. To these ends, the ML pipeline should be instrumented to log system metadata, model\\nmetadata, and data itself.\\nMonitoring for data quality issues and data drifts is crucial to catch deviations in model behavior, particularly those that\\nare non-obvious in the model or product end-performance. Data logging is unique in the context of ML systems: data\\nlogs should capture statistical properties of input features and model predictions, and capture their anomalies. With\\nmonitoring for data, concept, and model drifts, the logs are to be sent to the relevant systems, applied, and research\\nengineers. The latter is often non-trivial, as the model server is not ideal for model “observability” because it does not\\nnecessarily have the right data points to link the complex layers needed to analyze and debug models. To this end,\\nMLTRL requires the drift tests to be implemented at stages well ahead of deployment, earlier than is standard practice.\\nAgain we advocate for data-ﬁrst architectures rather than the software industry-standard design by services (discussed\\nlater), which aids in surfacing and logging the relevant data types and slices when monitoring AI systems. For retraining\\nand improving models, monitoring must be enabled to catch training-serving skew and let the team know when to\\nretrain. Towards model improvements, adding or modifying features can often have unintended consequences, such as\\nintroducing latencies or even bias. To mitigate these risks, MLTRL has an embedded switchback here: any component\\nor module changes to the deployed version must cycle back to Level 7 (integrations stage) or earlier. Additionally,\\nfor quality ML products, we stress a deﬁned communication path for user feedback without roadblocks to R&D; we\\nencourage real-world feedback all the way to research, providing valuable problem constraints and perspectives.\\nLevel 9 data – Proper mechanisms for logging and inspecting data (alongside models) is critical for deploying reliable\\nAI and ML – systems that learn on data have unique monitoring requirements (detailed above). In addition to the\\ninfrastructure and test suites covering data and environment shifts, it’s important for product managers and other owners\\nto be on top of data policy shifts in domains such as ﬁnance and healthcare.\\nLevel 9 review – The review at this stage is unique, as it also helps in lifecycle management: at a regular cadence\\nthat depends on the deployed system and domain of use, owners and other stakeholders are to revisit this review and\\nrecommend switchbacks if needed (discussed in the Methods section). This additional oversight at deployment is\\nshown to help deﬁne regimented release cycles of updated versions, and provide another “eye” check for stale model\\nperformance or other system abnormalities.\\nNotice MLTRL is deﬁned as stages or levels, yet much of the value in practice is realized in the transitions: MLTRL\\nenables teams to move from one level to the next reliably and efﬁciently, and provides a guide for how teams and\\nobjectives evolve with the progressing technology.\\nDiscussion\\nMLTRL is designed to apply to many real-world use-cases involving data and ML, from simple regression models\\nused for predictive modeling energy demand or anomaly detection in datacenters, to real-time modeling in rideshare\\napplications and motion planning in warehouse robotics. For simple use-cases MLTRL may be overkill, and a subset\\nmay sufﬁce – for instance, model cards as demonstrated by Google for basic image classiﬁcation. Yet this is a ﬁne line,\\nas the same cards-only approach in the popular “Huggingface” codebases are too simplistic for the language models\\nthey represent, deployed in domains that carry signiﬁcant consequences.

An example we discuss here is a\\nnovel approach to representing data in generative vision models from Naud & Lavin[ 23], which was then developed into\\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection, and targeted for two human-machine visual inspection applications:\\nFirst, industrial anomaly detection, notably in precision manufacturing, to identify potential errors for human-expert\\nmanual inspection. Second, using the model to improve the accuracy and efﬁciency of neuropathology, the microscopic\\nexamination of neurosurgical specimens for cancerous tissue. In these human-machine teaming use-cases there are\\nspeciﬁc challenges impeding practical, reliable use:\\n•Hidden feedback loops can be common and problematic in real-world systems inﬂuencing their own training\\ndata: over time the behavior of users may evolve to select data inputs they prefer for the speciﬁc AI system,\\nrepresenting some skew from the training data. In this neuropathology case, selecting whole-slide images that\\nare uniquely difﬁcult for manual inspection, or even biased by that individual user. Similarly we see underlying\\nhealthcare processes can act as hidden confounders, resulting in unreliable decision support tools[26].\\n•Model availability can be limited in many deployment settings: for example, on-premises deployments\\n(common in privacy preserving domains like healthcare and banking), edge deployments (common in industrial\\nuse-cases such as manufacturing and agriculture), or from the infrastructure’s inability to scale to the volume\\nof requests. This can severely limit the team’s ability to monitor, debug, and improve deployed models.\\n•Uncertainty estimation is valuable in many AI scenarios, yet not straightforward to implement in practice.\\nThis is further complicated with multiple data sources and users, each injecting generally unknown amounts of\\nnoise and uncertainties. In medical applications it is of critical importance, to provide measures of conﬁdence\\nand sensitivity, and for AI researchers through end-users. In anomaly detection, various uncertainty measures\\ncan help calibrate the false-positive versus false-negative rates, which can be very domain speciﬁc.\\n8'),\n",

Note\\nthis is a subset of a full TRL Card, which in reality lives as a full document in an internal wiki. Notice the card\\nclearly communicates the data sources, versions, and assumptions. This helps mitigate invalid assumptions about\\nperformance and generalizability when moving from R&D to production, and promotes the use of real-world data\\nearlier in the project lifecycle. We recommend documenting datasets thoroughly with semantic versioning and tools\\nsuch as datasheets for datasets [24], and following data accountability best-practices as they evolve (see [25]).\\n•Costs of edge cases can be signiﬁcant, sometimes risking expensive machine downtime or medical failures.\\nThis is exacerbated in anomaly detection anomalies are by deﬁnition rare so they can be difﬁcult to train for,\\nespecially for the anomalies that are completely unseen until they arise in the wild.\\n•End-user trust can be difﬁcult to achieve, often preventing the adoption of ML applications, particularly in\\nthe healthcare domain and other highly regulated industries.\\nThese and additional ML challenges such as data privacy and interpretability can inhibit ML adoption in clinical practice\\nand industrial settings, but can be mitigated with MLTRL processes. We’ll describe how in the context of the Naud\\n& Lavin[ 23] example, which began at level 0 with theoretical ML work on manifold geometries, and at level 5 was\\ndirected towards specialized human-machine teaming applications utilizing the same ML method under-the-hood.\\n•Levels 0-1 – From open-ended exploration of data-representation properties in various Riemmanian manifold\\ncurvatures, we derived from ﬁrst principles and empirically identiﬁed a property with hyperbolic manifolds:\\nwhen used as a latent space for embedding data without labels, the geometry organizes the data by it’s implicit\\nhierarchical structure. Unsupervised computer vision was identiﬁed in reviews as a promising direction for\\nproof-of-principle work.\\n•Level 2 – One approach for validating the earlier theoretical developments was to generate synthetic data to\\nisolate very speciﬁc features in data we would expect represented in the latent manifold. The results showed\\npromise for anomaly detection – using the latent representation of data to automatically identify images that\\nare out-of-the-ordinary (anomalous), and also using the manifold to inspect how they are semantically different.\\nFurther, starting with an implicitly probabilistic modeling approach implied uncertainty estimation could be\\na valuable feature downstream. This made the level 2 key decision point clear: proceed with applied ML\\ndevelopment.\\n•Levels 3-5 – Proof-of-concept development and reviews demonstrated promise for several commercial appli-\\ncations relevant to the business, and also highlighted the need for several key features (deﬁned as R&D and\\nproduct requirements): interpretability (towards end-user trust), uncertainty quantiﬁcation (to show conﬁdence\\nscores), and human-in-the-loop (for domain expertise). Without the MLTRL PoC steps and review processes,\\nthese features can often be delayed until beta testing or overlooked completely – for example, the failures of\\napplying IBM Watson in medical applications [ 27].

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'random.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='From the systems perspective, we suggest quantifying the uncertainties of components and propagating them\\nthrough the system, which can improve safety and trust. Probabilistic ML methods, rooted in Bayesian\\nprobability theory, provide a principled approach to representing and manipulating uncertainty about models\\nand predictions[ 28]. For this reason we advocate strongly for probabilistic models and algorithms in AI\\nsystems. In this machine vision example, the MLTRL technical requirements speciﬁcally called for a\\nprobabilistic generative model to readily quantify various types of uncertainties and propagate them forward to\\nthe visualization component of the pipeline, and the product requirements called for the downstream conﬁdence\\nand sensitivity measures to be exposed to the end-user. Component uncertainties must be assembled in a\\nprincipled way to yield a meaningful measure of overall system uncertainty, based on which safe decisions can\\nbe made[29]. See the Methods section for more on uncertainty in AI systems.\\nThe early checks for data management and governance proved valuable here, as the application areas dealt\\nwith highly sensitive data that would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the design of data pipelines and test suites. In\\nboth the neuropathology and manufacturing applications, the data management checks also raised concerns\\nabout hidden feedback loops, where users may unintentionally skew the data inputs when using the anomaly\\ndetection models in practice, for instance biasing the data towards speciﬁc subsets they subjectively need help\\nwith. Incorporating domain experts this early in the project lifecycle helped inform veriﬁcation and validation\\nsteps to help be robust to the hidden feedback loops. Not to mention their input guided us towards user-centric\\nmetrics for performance, which can often skew from ML metrics in important ways – for instance, the typical\\nacceptance ratio for false positives versus false negatives doesn’t apply to select edge cases, for which our\\nhierarchical anomaly classiﬁcation scheme was useful [23].\\nFrom prior reviews and TRL card documentation, we also identiﬁed the value of synthetic data generation\\ninto application development: anomalies are by deﬁnition rare so they are hard to come by in real datasets,\\nespecially with evolving environments in deployment settings, so the ability to generate synthetic datasets for\\nanomaly detection can accelerate the level 6-9 pipeline, and help ensure more reliable models in the wild.\\n•Level 6 (medical) – The medical inspection application experienced a bifurcation with product work proceed-\\ning while additional R&D was desired to explore improved data processing methods, while engaging with\\nclinicians and medical researchers for feedback. Proceeding through the levels in a non-linear, non-monotonic\\nway is common in MLTRL and encouraged by various switchback mechanisms (detailed in the Methods\\nsection). These practices – intentional switchbacks, frequent engagement with domain experts and users – can\\nhelp mitigate methodological ﬂaws and underlying biases that are common when applying ML to clinical\\napplications. For instance, recent work by Roberts et al. [ 30] investigated 2,122 studies applying ML to\\nCOVID-19 use-cases, ﬁnding that none of the models are sufﬁcient for clinical use due to methodological ﬂaws\\nand/or underlying biases. They go on to give many recommendations – some we’ve discussed in the context of\\nMLTRL, and more – which should be reviewed for higher quality medical-ML models and documentation.\\n•Level 6-9 (manufacturing) – Overall these stages proceeded regularly and efﬁciently for the defect detection\\nproduct. MLTRL’s embedded switchback from level 9 to 4 proved particularly useful in this lifecycle, both\\nfor incorporating feedback from the ﬁeld and for updating with research progress. On the former, the data\\ndistribution shifts from one deployment setting to another signiﬁcantly affected false-positive versus false-\\nnegative calibrations, so this was added as a feature to the CI/CD pipelines. On the latter, the built-in touch\\npoints for real-world feedback and data into the continued ML research provided valuable constraints to\\nhelp guide research, and product managers could readily understand what capabilities could be available for\\nproduct integration and when (readily communicated with TRL Cards) – for instance, later adding support for\\nvideo-based inspection for defects, and tooling for end-users to reason about uncertainty estimates (which\\nhelps establish trust).\\n•Level 7-9 (medical) – For productization the “neuropathology copilot” was handed off to a partner pharmaceu-\\ntical company to integrate into their existing software systems. The MLTRL documentation and communication\\nstreamlined the technology transfer, which can often by a time-consuming manual process. If not pursuing\\nthis path, the product would’ve likely faced many of the medical-ML deployment challenges with model\\navailability and data access; MLTRL cannot overcome the technical challenges of deploying on-premises, but\\nthe manifestation of those challenges as performance regressions, data shifts, privacy and ethics concerns, etc.\\ncan be mitigated by the system-level checks and strategies MLTRL puts forth.\\nComputer vision with real and synthetic data\\nAdvancements in physics engines and graphics processing have advanced AI environment and data-generation capabili-\\nties, putting increased emphasis on transitioning models across the simulation-to-reality gap [ 31,32,33].

Additional emphasis is\\nplaced on ML tests that consider the mix of real-world data with user annotations (b, right) and synthetic data generated\\nby Unity AI’s Perception tool and structured domain randomization (b, left).\\ncomplement real-world data sources (Figure 4). This application exempliﬁes three important challenges in ML product\\ndevelopment that MLTRL helps overcome:\\n•Multiple and disparate data sources are common in deployed ML pipelines yet often ignored in R&D.\\nFor instance, upstream data providers can change formats unexpectedly, or a physical event could cause the\\ncustomer behavior to change. It is nearly impossible to anticipate and design for all potential problems with\\nreal-world data and deployment. This computer vision system implemented pipelines and extended test suites\\nto cover open-source benchmark data, real user data, and synthetic data.\\n•Hidden performance degradation can be challenging to detect and debug in ML systems because gradual\\nchanges in performance may not be immediately visible. Common reasons for this challenge are that the\\nML component may be one step in a series. Additionally, local/isolated changes to an ML component’s\\nperformance may not directly affect the observed downstream performance. We can see both issues in the\\nillustrated logic diagram for the automated recycling app (Figure 4). A slight degradation in the initial CV\\nmodel may not heavily inﬂuence the following user input. However, when an uncommon input image appears\\nin the future, the app fails altogether.\\n•Model usage requirements can make or break an ML product. For example, the Netﬂix “$1M Prize” solution\\nwas never fully deployed because of signiﬁcant engineering costs in real-world scenariosv. For example,\\nengineering teams must communicate memory usage, compute power requirements, hardware availability,\\nnetwork privacy, and latency to the ML teams. ML teams often only understand the statistics or ML theory\\nbehind a model but not the system requirements or how it scales.\\nWe next elucidate these challenges and how MLTRL helps overcome them in the context of this project’s lifecycle. This\\nproject started at level 4, using largely existing ML methods with a target use-case.\\n•Level 4 – For this project, we validated most of the components in other projects. Speciﬁcally, the computer\\nvision (CV) model for object recognition and classiﬁcation was an off-the-shelf model. The synthetic data\\ngeneration method used Unity Perception, a well-established open-source project.

The MLTRL prototype-caliber code checkpoint ensures that the existing code components\\nare validated and helps avoid poorly deﬁned borders and abstractions between components. ML pipelines\\noften grow out of glue code, and our regimented code checkpoints motivate well-architected software that\\nminimizes these danger spots.\\n•Level 5 – The problematic “valley of death”, mentioned earlier in the level 5 deﬁnitions, is less prevalent in use-\\ncases like this that start at a higher MLTRL level with a speciﬁc product deliverable. In this case, the product\\ndeliverable was a real-time object recognition and classiﬁcation of trash for a mobile recycling application.\\nStill, this stage is critical for the requirements and V&V transition. This stage mitigates failure risks due to the\\ndisparate data sources integrated at various steps in this CV system and accounted for the end-user compute\\nconstraints for mobile computing. Speciﬁcally, the TRL cards from earlier stages surfaced potential issues\\nwith imbalanced datasets and the need for speciﬁc synthetic images. These considerations are essential for the\\ndata readiness and testing V&V in the productization requirements. Data quality and availability issues often\\npresent huge blockers because teams discover them too late in the game. Data-readiness is one class of many\\nexample issues teams face without MLTRL, as depicted in Fig. 2.\\n•Level 6 – We were re-using a well-understood model and deployment pipeline in this use-case, meaning our\\nprimary challenge was around data reliability. For the problem of recognizing and classifying trash, building a\\nreliable data source using only real data is almost impossible due to diversity, class imbalance, and annotation\\nchallenges. Therefore we chose to develop a synthetic data generator to create training data. At this MLTRL\\nlevel, we needed to ensure that the synthetic data generator created sufﬁciently diverse data and exposed the\\ncontrols needed to alter the data distribution in production. Therefore, we carefully exposed APIs using the\\nUnity Perception package, which allowed us to control lighting, camera parameters, target and non-target\\nobject placements and counts, and background textures. Additionally, we ensured that the object labeling\\nmatched the real-world annotator instructions and that output data formats matched real-world counterparts.\\nLastly, we established a set of statistical tests to compare synthetic and real-world data distributions. The\\nMLTRL checks ensured that we understood, and in this case, adequately designed our data sources to meet\\nin-production requirements.\\n•Level 7 – From the previous level’s R&D TRL cards and observations, we knew relatively early in produc-\\ntization that we would need to assume bias for the real data sources due to class imbalance and imperfect\\nannotations. Therefore we designed tests to monitor these in the deployed application. MLTRL imposes these\\ncritical deployment tests well ahead of deployment, where we can easily overlook ML-speciﬁc failure modes.\\n•Level 8 – As we suggested earlier, problems that stem from real-world data are near impossible to anticipate\\nand design for, implying the need for level 8 ﬂight-readiness preparations. Given that we were generating\\nsynthetic images (with structured domain randomization) to complement the real data, we created tests for\\ndifferent data distribution shifts at multiple points in the classiﬁcation pipeline. We also implemented thorough\\nshadow tests ahead of deployment to evaluate how susceptible the ML model(s) to performance regressions\\ncaused by data. Additionally, we also implemented these as CI/CD tests over various deployment scenarios (or\\nmobile device computing speciﬁcations). Without these fully covered, documented, and automated, it would\\nbe impossible to pass level 8 review and deploy the technology.\\n•Level 9 – Post-deployment, the monitoring tests prescribed at Levels 8 and 9 and the three main code quality\\ncheckpoints in the MLTRL process help surface hidden performance degradation problems, common with\\ncomplex pipelines of data ﬂows and various models. The switchbacks depicted in Fig. 2 are typical in CV\\nuse-cases. For instance, miscalibrations in models pre-trained on synthetic data and ﬁne-tuned on newer real\\ndata can be common yet difﬁcult to catch. However, the level 7 to 4 switchback is designed precisely for these\\nchallenges and product improvements.\\nAccelerating scientiﬁc discovery with massive particle physics simulators\\nComputational models and simulation are key to scientiﬁc advances at all scales, from particle physics, to material\\ndesign and drug discovery, to weather and climate science, and to cosmology[ 35]. Many simulators model the forward\\nevolution of a system (coinciding with the arrow of time), such as the interaction of elementary particles, diffusion of\\ngasses, folding of proteins, or evolution of the universe in the largest scale. The task of inference refers to ﬁnding initial\\nconditions or global parameters of such systems that can lead to some observed data representing the ﬁnal outcome\\nof a simulation. In probabilistic programming[ 36], this inference task is performed by deﬁning prior distributions\\nover any latent quantities of interest, and obtaining posterior distributions over these latent quantities conditioned\\non observed outcomes (for example, experimental data) using Bayes rule. This process, in effect, corresponds to\\ninverting the simulator such that we go from the outcomes towards the inputs that caused the outcomes. In the\\n“Etalumis” project[ 37] (“simulate” spelled backwards), we are using probabilistic programming methods to invert\\n12'),\n",

The project is as an interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists\\nin probabilistic machine learning, particle physics, and high-performance computing, all essential elements to achieve\\nthe project outcomes. Even more, it is a multi-year project spanning multiple countries, companies, university labs, and\\ngovernment research organizations, bringing signiﬁcant challenges in project management, technology coordination\\nand validation. Aided by MLTRL, there were several key challenges to overcome in this project that are common in\\nscientiﬁc-ML projects:\\n•Integrating with legacy systems is common in scientiﬁc and industrial use-cases, where ML methods are\\napplied with existing sensor networks, infrastructure, and codebases. In this case, particle physics domain\\nexperts at CERN are using the SHERPA simulator[ 38], a 1 million line codebase developed over the last\\ntwo decades. Rewriting the simulator for ML use-cases is infeasible due to the codebase size and buried\\ndomain knowledge, and new ML experts would need signiﬁcant onboarding to gain working knowledge of\\nthe codebase. It is also common to work with legacy data infrastructure, which can be poorly organized for\\nmachine learning (let alone preprocessed and clean) and unlikely to have followed best practices such as\\ndataset versioning.\\n•Coupling hardware and software architectures is non-trivial when deploying ML at scale, as performance\\nconstraints are often considered in deployment tests well after model and algorithm development, not to\\nmention the expertise is often split across disjoint teams. This can be exacerbated in scientiﬁc-ML when\\nscaling to supercomputing infrastructure, and working with massive datasets that can be in the terabytes and\\npetabytes.\\n•Interpretability is often a desired feature yet difﬁcult to deliver and validate in practice. Particularly in\\nscientiﬁc ML applications such as this, mechanisms and tooling for domain experts to interpret predictions\\nand models are key for usability (integrating in workﬂows and building trust).\\nTo this end, we will go through the MLTRL levels one by one, demonstrating how they ensure the above scientiﬁc ML\\nchallenges are diligently addressed.\\n•Level 0 – The theoretical developments leading to Etalumis are immense and well discussed in Baydin et\\nal [37]. In particular the ML theory and methods are in a relatively nascent area of ML and mathematics,\\nprobabilistic programming. New territory can present more challenges compared to well-traveled research\\npaths, for instance in computer vision with neural networks. It is thus helpful to have a guiding framework\\nwhen making a new path in ML research, such as MLTRL where early reviews help theoretical ML projects\\nget legs.\\n•Level 1-2 – Running low-level experiments in simple testbeds is generally straightforward when working\\nwith probabilistic programming and simulation; in a sense, this easy iteration over experiments is what\\nPPL are designed for. It was additionally helpful in this project to have rich data grounded in physical\\nconstraints, allowing us to better isolate model behaviors (rather than data assumptions and noise). The\\nMLTRL requirements documentation is particularly useful for the standard PPL experimentation workﬂow:\\nmodel, infer, criticize, repeat (or Box’s loop) [ 39]. The evaluation step (i.e. criticizing the model) can be\\nmore nuanced than checking summary statistics as in deep learning and similar ML workﬂows. It is thus a\\nuseful practice to write down the criticism methods, metrics, and expected results as veriﬁcations for speciﬁc\\nresearch requirements, rather than iterating over Box’s loop without a priori targets. Further, because this\\nresearch project had a speciﬁc target application early in the process (the SHERPA simulator), the project\\ntimeline beneﬁted from recognizing simulator-integration constraints upfront as requirements, not to mention\\ndata availability concerns, which are often overlooked in early R&D levels. It was additionally useful to have\\nCERN scientists as domain experts in the reviews at these R&D levels.\\n•Level 3 – Systems development can be challenging with probabilistic programming, again because it is\\nrelatively nascent and much of the out-of-the-box tools and infrastructure are not there as in most ML and\\ndeep learning. Here in particular there’s a novel (unproven) approach for systems integration: a probabilistic\\nprogramming execution protocol was developed to reroute random number draws in the stochastic simulator\\ncodebase (SHERPA) to the probabilistic programming system, thus enabling the system to control stochastic\\nchoices in SHERPA and run inference on its execution traces, all while keeping the legacy codebase intact! A\\nmore invasive method that modiﬁes SHERPA would not have been acceptable. If it were not for MLTRL forcing\\nsystems considerations this early in the Etalumis project lifecycle, this could have been an insurmountable\\nhurdle later when multiple codebases and infrastructures come into play. By the same token, systems planning\\nhere helped enable the signiﬁcant HPC scaling later: the team deﬁned the need for HPC support well ahead\\nof actually running HPC, in order to build the prototype code in a way that would readily map to HPC (in\\naddition to local or cloud CPU and GPU).

Leveraging cyclic R&D methods, the Etalumis project could iteratively improve inference\\nmethods without stalling the broader system development, ultimately producing the largest scale posterior\\ninference in a Turing-complete probabilistic programming system. Achieving this scale through iterative R&D\\nalong the main project lifecycle was additionally enabled by working with with NERSC engineers and their\\nCori supercomputer to progressively scale smaller R&D tests to the goal supercomputing deployment scenario.\\nTypical ML workﬂows that follow simple linear progressions[ 6,40] would not enable ramping up in this\\nfashion, and can actual prevent scaling R&D to production due to lack of systems engineering processes (like\\nMLTRL) connecting research to deployment.\\n•Level 5 – Multi-org international collaborations can be riddled with communication and teamwork issues,\\nin particular at this pivotal stage where teams transition from R&D to application and product development.\\nFirst, MLTRL as a lingua franca was key to the team effort bringing Etalumis proof-of-concept into the\\nlarger effort of applying it to massive high-energy physics simulators. It was also critical at this stage to\\nclearly communicate end-user requirements across the various teams and organizations, which must be deﬁned\\nin MLTRL requirements docs with V&V measures – the essential science-user requirements were mainly\\nfor model and prediction interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and code usability. If there are concerns\\nover these features, MLTRL switchbacks can help to quickly cycle back and improve modeling choices in a\\ntransparent, efﬁcient way – generally in ML projects, these fundamental issues with usability are caught too\\nlate, even after deployment. In the probabilistic generative model setting we’ve deﬁned in Etalumis, Bayesian\\ninference gives results that are interpretable because they include exact locations and processes in the model\\nthat are associated with each prediction. Working with ML methods that are inherently interpretable, we are\\nwell-positioned to deliver interpretable interfaces for the end-users later in the project lifecycle.\\n•Level 6-9 – The standard MLTRL protocol apply in these application-to-deployment stages, with several\\nEtalumis-speciﬁc highlights. First, given the signiﬁcant research contributions in both probabilistic pro-\\ngramming and scientiﬁc-ML, it’s important to share the code publicly. The development and deployment\\nof the open-source code repository PPXvibranched into a separate MLTRL path from the Etalumis path\\nfor deployment at CERN. It’s useful to have systems engineering enable clean separation of requirements,\\ndeployments, etc. when there are different development and product lifecycles originating from a common\\nparent project. For example, in this case it was useful to employ MLTRL switchbacks in the open-sourcing\\nprocess, isolated from the CERN application paths, in order to add support for additional programming\\nlanguages so PPX can apply to more scientiﬁc simulators – both directions beneﬁted signiﬁcantly the from\\nthe data pipelines considerations brought up levels earlier, where open-sourcing required different data APIs\\nand data transformations to enable broad usability. Second, related to the open-source code deliverable and\\nthe scientiﬁc ML user requirements we noted above, the late stages of MLTRL reviews include higher level\\nstakeholders and speciﬁc end-users, yet again enforcing these scientiﬁc usability requirements are met. An\\nexample result of this in Etalumis is the ability to output human-readable execution traces of the SHERPA\\nruns and inference, enabling never before possible step-by-step interpretability of the black-box simulator.\\nThe scientiﬁc ML perspective additionally brings to forefront an end-to-end data perspective that is pertinent in\\nessentially all ML use-cases: these systems are only useful to the extent they provide comprehensive data analyses that\\nintegrate the data consumed and generated in these workﬂows, from raw domain data to machine-learned models. These\\ndata analyses drive reproducibility, explainability, and experiment data understanding, which are critical requirements\\nin scientiﬁc endeavors and ML broadly.\\nCausal inference & ML in medicine\\nUnderstanding cause and effect relationships is crucial for accurate and actionable decision-making in many settings,\\nfrom healthcare and epidemiology, to economics and government policy development. Unfortunately, standard\\nmachine learning algorithms can only ﬁnd patterns and correlation in data, and as correlation is not causation, their\\npredictions cannot be conﬁdently used for understanding cause and effect.

Fortunately, there has been much recent development in a ﬁeld known as causal inference that\\ncan quantitatively make sense of cause and effect from purely observational data[ 43]. The ability of causal inference\\nalgorithms to quantify causal impact rests on a number of important checks and assumptions–beyond those employed\\nin standard machine learning or purely statistical methodology–that must be carefully deliberated over during their\\ndevelopment and training. These speciﬁc checks and assumptions are as follows:\\n•Specifying cause-and-effect relationships between relevant variables– One of the most important assump-\\ntions underlying causal inference is the structure of the causal relations between quantities of interest. The\\ngold standard for determining causal relations is to perform a randomised controlled trial, but in most cases\\nthese cannot be employed due to ethical concerns, technological infeasibility, or prohibitive cost. In these\\nsituations, domain experts have to be consulted to determine the causal relationships. It is important in these\\nsituations to carefully address the manner in which such domain knowledge was extracted from experts, the\\nnumber and diversity of experts involved, the amount of consensus between experts, and so on. The need for\\ncareful documentation of this knowledge and its periodic review is made clear in the MLTRL framework, as\\nwe shall see below.\\n•Identiﬁability– Another vital component of building causal models is whether the causal question of interest\\nisidentiﬁable from the causal structure speciﬁed for the model together with observational (and sometimes\\nexperimental) data.\\n•Adjusting for and monitoring confounding bias– An important aspect of causal model performance, not\\npresent in standard machine learning algorithms, is confounding bias adjustment. The standard approach is to\\nemploy propensity score matching to remove such bias. However, the quality of bias adjustment achieved in\\nany speciﬁc instance with such propensity-based matching methods needs to be checked and documented,\\nwith alternate bias adjusting procedure required if appropriate levels of bias adjustment are not achieved[44].\\n•Sensitivity analysis– As causal estimates are based on generally untestable assumptions, such as observing all\\nrelevant confounders, it is vital to determine how sensitive the resulting predictions are to potential violations\\nof these assumptions.\\n•Consistency– It is crucial to understand if the learned causal estimate provably converges to the true causal\\neffect in the limit of inﬁnite sample size. However, causal models cannot be validated by standard held-out\\ntests, but rather require randomization or special data collection strategies to evaluate their predictions [ 45,46].\\nThe MLTRL framework makes transparent the need to carefully document and defend these assumptions, thus ensuring\\nthe safe and robust creation, deployment, and maintenance of causal models. We elucidate this with recent work by\\nRichens et al.[ 47], developing a causal approach to computer-assisted diagnosis which outperforms previous purely\\nmachine learning based methods. To this end, we will go through the MLTRL levels one by one, demonstrating how\\nthey ensure the above speciﬁc checks and assumptions are naturally accounted for. This should provide a blueprint for\\nhow to employ the MLTRL levels in other causal inference applications.\\n•Level 0 – When initially faced with a causal inference task, the ﬁrst step is always to understand the causal\\nrelationships between relevant variables. For instance, in Richens et al. [ 47], the ﬁrst step toward building\\nthe diagnostic model was specifying the causal relationships between the diverse set risk factors, diseases,\\nand symptoms included in the model. To learn these relations, doctors and healthcare professionals were\\nconsulted to employ their expansive medical domain knowledge which was robustly evaluated by additional\\nindependent groups of healthcare professionals. The MLTRL framework ensured this issue is dealt with and\\ndocumented correctly, as such knowledge is required to progress from Level 0; failure to do this has plagued\\nsimilar healthcare AI projects [48].\\nThe next step of any causal analysis is to understand whether the causal question of interest is uniquely\\nidentiﬁable from the causal structure speciﬁed for the model together with observational and experimental data.\\nIn this medical diagnosis example, identiﬁcation was crucial to establish, as the causal question of interest,\\n“would the observed symptoms not be present had a speciﬁc disease been cured?”, was highly non-trivial.\\nAgain, MLTRL ensures this vital aspect of model building is carefully considered, as a mathematical proof of\\nidentiﬁability would be required to graduate from Level 0.\\nWith both the causal structure and identiﬁability result in hand, one can progress to Level 1.\\n•Level 1 – At this level, the goal is to take the estimand for the identiﬁed causal question of interest and\\ndevise a way to estimate it from data. To do this one will need efﬁcient ways to adjust for confounﬁng bias.\\nThe standard approach is to employ propensity score-based methods to remove such bias when the target\\ndecision is binary, and use multi-stage ML models adhering to the assumed causal structure[ 49] for continuous\\ntarget decisions (and high-dimensional data in general). However, the quality of bias adjustment achieved in\\nany speciﬁc instance with propensity-based matching methods needs to be checked and documented, with\\n15'),\n",

Still, in many cases, it is not\\npossible to completely remove confounding in the observed data. TRL Cards offer a transparent way to declare\\nspeciﬁc limitations of a causal ML method.\\n•Level 2 – PoC-level tests for causal models must go beyond that of typical ML models. As discussed above,\\nto ensure the estimated causal effects are robust to the assumptions required for their derivation, sensitivity\\nto these assumptions must be analysed. Such sensitivity analysis is often limited to R&D experiments or\\na post-hoc feature of ML products. MLTRL on the other hand requires this throughout the lifecycle as\\ncomponents of ML test suites and gated reviews. In the case of causal ML, best practice is to employ sensitivity\\nanalysis for this robustness check[ 50].

And\\nPoC validation steps are more efﬁcient with MLTRL because the process facilitates early speciﬁcation of the\\nevaluation metric for a causal model in Level 2.

Initially, resident scientists would retrieve\\nhard-disks containing video data captured each night and perform manual triangulation of tracks or streaks of light\\nin the night sky, and compute a meteor’s trajectory, orbit, and lightcurve. Each solution was manually classiﬁed as a\\nmeteor or not (i.e., planes, birds, clouds, etc). In 2017, a project run by the Frontier Development Labvii[52], the AI\\naccelerator for NASA and ESA, aimed to automate the data processing pipeline and replicate the scientists thought\\nprocess to build an ML model that identiﬁes meteors in the CAMS project [ 53,54]. The data automation led to\\norders of magnitude improvements in operational efﬁciency of the system, and allowed new contributors and amateur\\nastronomers to start contributing to meteor sightings. Additionally, a novel web tool allowed anybody anywhere to\\nview the meteors detected in the previous night. The CAMS camera system has had six-fold global expansion of the\\ndata capture network, discovered ten new meteor showers, contributed towards instrumental evidence of previously\\npredicted comets, and helped calculate parent bodies of various meteor showers. CAMS utilized the MLTRL framework\\nto progress as described:\\n•Level 1 – Understanding the domain and data is a prerequisite for any ML development. Extensive data\\nexploration elucidated visual differences between objects in the night sky such as meteors, satellites, clouds,\\ntail lights of planes, light from the eyes of cats peering into cameras, trees, and other tall objects visible in\\nthe moonlight. This step helped (1) understand visual properties of meteors that later deﬁned the ML model\\narchitecture, and (2) mitigate impact of data imbalance by proactively developing domain-oriented strategies.\\nThe results are well-documented on a datasheet associated with the TRL card, and discussed at the stage\\nreview. This MLTRL documentation forced us to consider data sharing and other privacy concerns at this early\\nconceptualization stage, which is certainly relevant considering CAMS is for open-source and gathering data\\nfrom myriad sources.\\n•Level 2-3 – The agile and non-monotonic (or non-linear) development prescribed by MLTRL allowed the\\nteam to ﬁrst develop an approximate end-to-end pipeline that offered a path to ML model deployment and\\nquick turnaround time to incorporate feedback from the regular gated reviews. Then, with relatively quicker\\nviiThe NASA Frontier Development Lab and partners open-source the code and data via the SpaceML platform: spaceml.org\\n16'),\n",

Throughout the levels, the MLTRL gated reviews were essential for making efﬁcient progress\\nwhile ensuring robustness and functionality that meets stakeholder needs. At this stage we highlight speciﬁc\\nadvantages of the MLTRL review processes that had instrumental effect on the project success: With the\\nrequired panel of mixed ML researchers and engineers, domain scientists, and product managers, the stage 4\\nreviews stressed the signiﬁcance of numerical improvements and comparison to existing baselines, and helped\\nidentify and overcome issues with data imbalance. The team likely would have overlooked these approaches\\nwithout the review from peers in diverse roles and teams. In general, the evolving panel of reviewers at\\ndifferent stages of the project was essential for covering a variety of veriﬁcation and validation measures –\\nfrom helping mitigate data challenges, to open-source code quality.\\n•Level 5 – To complete this R&D-to-productization level, a novel web tool called the NASA CAMS Meteor\\nShower Portalviiiwas created that allowed users to view meteor shower activity from the previous night and\\nverify meteor predictions generated by the ML model. This app development was valuable for A/B testing,\\nvalidating detected meteors and classiﬁed new meteor showers with human-AI interaction, and demonstrating\\nreal-world utility to stakeholders in review. ML processes without MLTRL miss out on these valuable\\ndevelopment by overlooking the need for such a demo tool.\\n•Level 6 – Application development was naturally driven by end-user feedback from the web app in level 5 –\\nwithout MLTRL it’s unlikely the team would be able to work with early productization feedback. With almost\\nreal time feedback coming in daily, newer methods for improving robustness of meteor identiﬁcation led to\\nresearching and developing a unique augmentation technique, resulting in the state of the art performance of\\nthe ML model. Further application development led to incorporating features that were in demand by users of\\nthe NASA CAMS Meteor Shower Portal: include celestial reference points through constellations, add ability\\nto zoom in/out and (un)cluster showers, and provide tooling for scientiﬁc communication. The coordination of\\nthese features into product-caliber codebase resulted in the release of the NASA CAMS Meteor Shower Portal\\n2.0 that was built by a team of citizen scientists – again we found the speciﬁc checkpoints in the MLTRL\\nreview were crucial for achieving these goals.\\n•Level 7 – Integration was particularly challenging in two ways. First, integrating the ML and data engineering\\ndeliverables with the existing infrastructure and tools of the larger CAMS system, which had started devel-\\nopment years earlier with other teams in partner organizations, required quantiﬁable progress for verifying\\nthe tech-readiness of ML models and modules. The use of technology readiness levels provided a clear and\\nconsistent metric for the maturity of the ML and data technologies, making for clear communication and\\nefﬁcient project integration. Without MLTRL it is difﬁcult to have a conversation, let alone make progress, to-\\nwards integrating AI/ML and data subsystems and components. Second, integrating open-source contributions\\ninto the main ML subsystem was a signiﬁcant challenge alleviated with diligent veriﬁcation and validation\\nmeasures from MLTRL, as well as quantifying robustness with ML testing suites (using scoring measures like\\nthat of the ML Testing Rubric[20], and devising a checklist based on metamorphic testing[18]).\\n•Level 8 – CAMS, like many datasets in practice, consisted of a smaller labeled subset and a much larger\\nunlabeled set. In an attempt to additionally increase robustness of the ML subsystem ahead of “ﬂight readiness”,\\nwe looked to active learning [ 55,56] techniques to leverage the unlabeled data. Models using an initial version\\nof this approach, where results of the active learning provided “weak” labels, resulted in consumption of the\\nentire decade long unlabelled data collected by CAMS and slightly higher scores on deployment tests. Active\\nlearning showed to be a promising feature and was switched back to level 7 for further development towards\\nthe next deployment version, so as not to delay the rest of the project.\\n•Level 9 – The ML components in CAMS require continual monitoring for model and data drifts, such as\\nchanges in weather, smoke, and cloud patterns that affect the view of the night sky. The data drifts may also be\\nspeciﬁc to locations, such as ﬁreﬂies and bugs in CAMS Australia and New Zealand stations which appear as\\nfalse positives. The ML pipeline is largely automated with CI/CD, runs regular regression tests, and production\\nof benchmarks. Manual intervention can be triggered when needed, such as sending low conﬁdence meteors for\\nveriﬁcation to scientists in the CAMS project. The team also regularly releases the code, models, and web tools\\non the open-source space sciences and exploration ML toolbox, SpaceMLix. Through the SpaceML community\\nand partner organizations, CAMS continually improves with feature requests, debugging, and improving data\\npractices, while tracking progress with standard software release cycles and MLTRL documentation.\\nviiimeteorshowers.seti.org\\nixspaceml.org\\n17'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'random.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='BEYOND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\\nSoftware engineering (SWE) practices vary signiﬁcantly across domains and industries. Some domains, such as medical\\napplications, aerospace, or autonomous vehicles rely on a highly rigorous development process which is required\\nby regulations. Other domains, for example advertising and e-commerce are not regulated and can employ a lenient\\napproach to development. ML development should at minimum inherit the acceptable software engineering practices of\\nthe domain. There are, however, several key areas where ML development stands out from SWE, adding its own unique\\nchallenges which even most rigorous SWE practices are not able to overcome.\\nFor instance, the behavior of ML systems is learned from data, not speciﬁed directly in code. The data requirements\\naround ML (i.e., data discovery, management, and monitoring) adds signiﬁcant complexity not seen in other types\\nof SWE. There are many beneﬁts to using a data-oriented architecture (DOA) [48] with the data-ﬁrst workﬂows and\\nmanagement practices prescribed in MLTRL. DOA aims to make the data ﬂowing between elements of business logic\\nmore explicit and accessible with a streaming-based architecture rather than the micro-service architectures that are\\nstandard in software systems. One speciﬁc beneﬁt of DOA is making data available and traceable by design, which\\nhelps signiﬁcantly in the ML logging challenges and data governance needs we discussed in Levels 7-9. Moreover,\\nMLTRL highlights data-related requirements along every step to ensure that the development process considers data\\nreadiness and availability.\\nNot to mention an array of ML-speciﬁc failure modes; for example, models that become miscalibrated due to subtle\\ndata distributional shifts in the deployment setting, resulting in models that are more conﬁdent in predictions than they\\nshould be. MLTRL helps deﬁne ML-speciﬁc testing considerations (levels 5 and 7) to help surface these failure-modes\\nearly. ML opens up new threat vectors across the whole deployment workﬂow that otherwise aren’t risks in software\\nsystems: for example, a poisoning attack to contaminate the training phase of ML systems, or membership inference\\nto see if a given data record was part of the model’s training. MLTRL consider these threat vectors and suggests\\nrelevant risk-identiﬁcation during prototyping and productization phases. More generally, ML codebases have all the\\nproblems for regular code, plus ML-speciﬁc issues at the system level, mainly as a consequence of added complexity\\nand dynamism. The resulting entanglement, for instance, implies that the SWE practice of making isolated changes is\\noften not feasible – Scully et al.[ 57] refer to this as the “changing anything changes everything” principle. Given this\\nconsideration, typical SWE change-management is insufﬁcient. Furthermore, ML systems almost necessarily increase\\nthe technical debt; package-level refactoring is generally sufﬁcient for removing technical debt in software systems, but\\nthis is not the case in ML systems.\\nThese factors and others suggest that inherited software engineering and management practices of a given domain are\\ninsufﬁcient for the successful development of robust and reliable ML systems. But it is not trading off one for the other:\\nMLTRL can be used in synergy with the existing, industry-standard software engineering practices such as agile [ 58]\\nand waterfall [ 59] to handle unique challenges of ML development. Because ML applications are a category of software,\\nall best practices of building and operating software should be extended when possible to the ML application. Practices\\nlike version control, comprehensive testing, continuous integration and continuous deployment are all applicable to ML\\ndevelopment. MLTRL provides a framework that helps extend SWE building and operating practices that are acceptable\\nin a given domain to tackle the unique challenges of ML development.\\nRELATED WORKS\\nA recent case study from Microsoft Research [ 40] similarly identiﬁes a few themes describing how ML is not equal to\\nsoftware engineering, and recommends a linear ML workﬂow with steps for data preparation through modeling and\\ndeploying. They deﬁne an effective workﬂow for isolated development of an ML model, but this approach does not\\nensure the technology is actually improving in quality and robustness. Their process should be repeated at progressive\\nstages of development in the broader ML and data technology lifecycle. If applied in the MLTRL framework, the\\nspeciﬁc ingredients of the ML model workﬂow – that is, people, software, tests, objectives, etc. – evolve over time and\\nsubsequent stages as the technologies mature.\\nThere exist many recommended workﬂows for speciﬁc ML methods and areas of pipelines. For instance, a more\\niterative process for Bayesian ML [ 60] and even more speciﬁcally for probabilistic programming [ 39], a data mining\\nprocess deﬁned in 2000 that remains widely used [ 61], others for describing data iterations [ 62], and human-computer\\ninteraction cycles [ 63]. In these recommended workﬂows and others, there’s an important distinction between their\\ncycles and “switchback” mechanisms in MLTRL. Their cycles suggest to generically iterate over a data-modeling-\\nevaluation-deployment process. Switchbacks, on the other hand, are speciﬁc, purpose-driven workﬂows for dialing\\npart(s) of a project to an earlier stage – this doesn’t simply mean go back and train the model on more data, but rather\\nswitching back regresses the technology’s maturity level (e.g. from level 5 to level 3) such that it must again fulﬁll the\\nlevel-by-level requirements, evaluations and reviews.

These isolated processes (that are speciﬁc to e.g. modeling in prototype development\\nor data wrangling in application development) are synergistic with MLTRL because they can be used within each level\\nof the larger lifecycle or framework. For example, the Bayesian modeling processes [ 39,60] we mentioned above\\nare really useful to guide developers of probabilistic ML approaches. But there are important distinctions between\\nexecuting these modeling steps and cycles in a well-deﬁned prototyping environment with curated data and minimal\\nresponsibilities, versus a production environment riddled with sparse and noisy data, that interacts with the physical\\nworld in non-obvious ways, and can carry expensive (even hidden) consequences. MLTRL provides the necessary,\\nholistic context and structure to use these and other development processes reliably and responsibly.\\nAlso related to our work, Google teams have proposed ML testing recommendations [ 20] and validating the data fed\\ninto ML systems [ 64]. For NLP applications, typical ML testing practices struggle to translate to real-world settings,\\noften overestimating performance capabilities. An effective way to address this is devising a checklist of linguistic\\ncapabilities and test types, as in Ribeiro et al.[ 17]–interestingly their test suite was inspired by metamorphic testing,\\nwhich we suggested earlier in Level 7 for testing systems AI integrations. A survey by Paleyes et al. [ 48] go over\\nnumerous case studies to discuss challenges in ML deployment. They similarly pay special attention to the need for\\nethical considerations, end-user trust, and extra security in ML deployments. On the latter point, Kumar et al. [ 65]\\nprovide a table thoroughly breaking down new threat vectors across the whole ML deployment workﬂow (some of\\nwhich we mentioned above). These works, notably the ML security measures and the quantiﬁcation of an ML test suite\\nin a principled way – i.e., that does not use misguided heuristics such as code coverage – are valuable to include in any\\nML workﬂow including MLTRL, and are synergistic with the framework we’ve described in this paper. These analyses\\nprovide useful insights, but they do not provide a holistic, regimented process for the full ML lifecycle from R&D\\nthrough deployment. An end-to-end approach is suggested by Raji et al.[ 66], but only for the speciﬁc task of auditing\\nalgorithms; components of AI auditing are mentioned in Level 7, and covered throughout in the review processes.\\nSculley et al.[ 57] go into more ML debt topics such as undeclared consumers and data dependencies, and go on to\\nrecommend an ML Testing Rubric as a production checklist [ 20]. For example, testing models by a canary process\\nbefore serving them into production. This, along with similar shadow testing we mentioned earlier, are common in\\nautonomous ML systems, notably robotics and autonomous vehicles. They explicitly call out tests in four main areas\\n(ML infrastructure, model development, features and data, and monitoring of running ML systems), some of which we\\ndiscussed earlier. For example, tests that the training and serving features compute the same values; a model may train\\non logged processes or user input, but is then served on a live feed with different inputs. In addition to the Google ML\\nTesting Rubric, we advocate metamorphic testing : a SWE methodology for testing a speciﬁc set of relations between\\nthe outputs of multiple inputs. True to the checklists in the Google ML Testing Rubric and in MLTRL, metamorphic\\ntesting for ML can have a codiﬁed list of metamorphic relations[18].\\nIn domains such as healthcare there have been the introduction of similar checklists for data readiness – for example,\\nto ensure regulatory-grade real-world-evidence (RWE) data quality [ 67] – yet these are nascent and not yet widely\\naccepted. Applying AI in healthcare has led to developing guidance for regulatory protocol, which is still a work in\\nprogress. Larson et al.[ 68] provide a comprehensive analysis for medical imaging and AI, arriving at several regulatory\\nframework recommendations that mirror what we outline as important measures in MLTRL: e.g., detailed task elements\\nsuch as pitfalls and limitations (surfaced on TRL Cards), clear deﬁnition of an algorithm relative to the downstream\\ntask, deﬁning the algorithm “capability” (Level 5), real-world monitoring, and more.\\nD’amour et al.[ 19] dive into the problem we noted earlier about model miscalibration.

This is largely problematic in deep learning pipelines, but we’ve also noted this\\nrisk in the case of causal inference applications.

MLTRL is derived from the processes and testing\\nstandards of spacecraft development, yet lean and efﬁcient for ML, data, and software workﬂows. Examples from\\nseveral organizations across industries demonstrate the efﬁcacy of MLTRL for AI and ML technologies, from research\\nand development through productization and deployment, in important domains such as healthcare and physics, with\\nemphasis on data readiness amongst other critical challenges. Our aim is MLTRL works in synergy with recent\\napproaches in the community focused on diligent data-readiness, privacy and security, and ethics. Even more, MLTRL\\nestablishes a much-needed lingua franca for the AI ecosystem, and broadly for AI in the worlds of science, engineering,\\nand business. Our hope is that our systems framework is adopted broadly in AI and ML organizations, and that\\n“technology readiness levels” becomes common nomenclature across AI stakeholders – from researchers and engineers\\nto sales-people and executive decision-makers.\\nMethods\\nGated reviews\\nAt the end of each stage is a dedicated review period: (1) Present the technical developments along with the requirements\\nand their corresponding veriﬁcation measures and validation steps, (2) make key decisions on path(s) forward (or\\nbackward) and timing, and (3) debrief the processx. As in the gated reviews deﬁned by TRL used by NASA, DARPA, et\\nal., MLTRL stipulates speciﬁc criteria for review at each level, as well as calling out speciﬁc key decision points (noted\\nin the level descriptions above). The designated reviewers will “graduate” the technology to the next level, or provide a\\nlist of speciﬁc tasks that are still needed (ideally with quantitative remarks). After graduation at each level, the working\\ngroup does a brief post-mortem; we ﬁnd that a quick day or two pays dividends in cutting away technical debt and\\nimproving team processes. Regular gated reviews are essential for making efﬁcient progress while ensuring robustness\\nand functionality that meets stakeholder needs. There are several important mechanisms in MLTRL reviews that are\\nspeciﬁcally useful with AI and ML technologies: First, the review panels evolve over a project lifecycle, as noted\\nbelow. Second, MLTRL prescribes that each review runs through an AI ethics checklist deﬁned by the organization; it is\\nimportant to repeat this at each review, as the review panel and stakeholders evolve considerably over a project lifecycle.\\nAs previously described in the levels deﬁnitions, including ethics reviews as an integral part of early system development\\nis essential for informing model speciﬁcations and avoiding unintended biases or harm[74] after deployment.\\nTRL “Cards”\\nIn Figure 3 we succinctly showcase a key deliverable: TRL Cards . The model cards proposed by Google [ 75] are a useful\\ndevelopment for external user-readiness with ML. On the other hand, our TRL Cards aim to be more information-dense,\\nlike datasheets for medical devices and engineering tools – see the open-source TRL Card repo for examples and\\ntemplates (to be released at github.com/alan-turing-institute). These serve as “report cards” that grow and improve upon\\ngraduating levels, and provide a means of inter-team and cross-functional communication. The content of a TRL Card\\nis roughly in two categories: project info, and implicit knowledge. The former clearly states info such as project owners\\nxMLTRL should include regular debriefs and meta-evaluations such that process improvements can be made in a data-driven,\\nefﬁcient way (rather than an annual meta-review).

In the latter\\ncategory are speciﬁc insights that are typically siloed in the ML development team but should be communicated to\\nother stakeholders: modeling assumptions, dataset biases, corner cases, etc. With the spread of AI and ML in critical\\napplication areas, we are seeing domain expert consortiums deﬁning AI reporting guidelines – e.g., Rivera et al.[ 76]\\ncalling for clinical trials reports for interventions involving AI – which will greatly beneﬁt from the use of our TRL\\nreporting cards. We stress that these TRL Cards are key for the progression of projects, rather than documentation\\nafterthoughts. The TRL Cards thus promote transparency and trust, within teams and across organizations. TRL Card\\ntemplates will be open-sourced upon publication of this work, including methods for coordinating use with other\\nreporting tools such as “Datasheets for Datasets” [24].\\nRisk mitigation\\nIdentifying and addressing risks in a software project is not a new practice. However, akin to the MLTRL roots in\\nspacecraft engineering, risk is a “ﬁrst-class citizen” here. In the deﬁnition of technical and product requirements, each\\nentry has a calculation of the form risk =p(failure )×value , where the value of a component is an integer 1−10.\\nBeing diligent about quantifying risks across the technical requirements is a useful mechanism for ﬂagging ML-related\\nvulnerabilities that can sometimes be hidden by layers of other software. MLTRL also speciﬁes that risk quantiﬁcation\\nand testing strategies are required for sim-to-real development. That is, there is nearly always a non-trivial gap in\\ntransferring a model or algorithm from a simulation testbed to the real world. Requiring explicit sim-to-real testing\\nsteps in the workﬂow helps mitigate unforeseen (and often hazardous) failures. Additionally, comprehensive ML test\\ncoverage that we mention throughout this paper is a critical strategy for mitigating risks anduncertainties: ML-based\\nsystem behavior is not easily speciﬁed in advance, but rather depends on dynamic qualities of the data and on various\\nmodel conﬁguration choices[20].\\nNon-monotonic, non-linear paths\\nWe observe many projects beneﬁt from cyclic paths, dialing components of a technology back to a lower level. Our\\nframework not only encourages cycles, we make them explicit with “switchback mechanisms” to regress the maturity\\nof speciﬁc components in an AI system:\\n1.Discovery switchbacks occur as a natural mechanism – new technical gaps are discovered through systems\\nintegration, sparking later rounds of component development[ 77]. These are most common in the R&D levels,\\nfor example moving a component of a proof-of-concept technology (at Level 4) back to proof-of-principle\\ndevelopment (Level 2).\\n2.Review switchbacks result from gated reviews, where speciﬁc components or larger subsystems may be dialed\\nback to earlier levels. This switchback is one of the “key decision points” in the MLTRL project lifecycle\\n(as noted in the Levels deﬁnitions), and is often a decision driven by business-needs and timing rather than\\ntechnical concerns (for instance when mission priorities and funds shift). This mechanism is common from\\nLevel 6/7 to 4, which stresses the importance of this R&D to product transition phase (see Figure 2 (left)).\\n3.Embedded switchbacks are predeﬁned in the MLTRL process. For example, a predeﬁned path from 4 to 2, and\\nfrom 9 to 4. In complex systems, particularly with AI technologies, these built-in loops help mitigate technical\\ndebt and overcome other inefﬁciencies such as noncomprehensive V&V steps.\\nWithout these built-in mechanisms for cyclic development paths, it can be difﬁcult and inefﬁcient to build systems of\\nmodules and components at varying degrees of maturity. Contrary to traditional thought that switchback events should\\nbe suppressed and minimized, in fact they represent a natural and necessary part of the complex technology development\\nprocess – efforts to eliminate them may stiﬂe important innovations without necessarily improving efﬁciency. This is\\na fault of the standard monotonic approaches in AI/ML projects, stage-gate processes, and even the traditional TRL\\nframework.\\nIt is also important to note that most projects do not start at Level 0; very few ML companies engage in this low-level\\ntheoretical research. For example, a team looking to use an off-the-shelf object recognition model could start that\\ntechnology at Level 3, and proceed with thorough V&V for their speciﬁc datasets and use-cases. However, no technology\\ncan skip levels after the MLTRL process has been initiated. The industry default (that is, without implementing MLTRL)\\nis to ignorantly take pretrained models, run ﬁne tuning on their speciﬁc data, and jump to deployment, effectively\\nskipping Levels 5 to 7. Additionally, we ﬁnd it is advantageous to incorporate components from other high-TRL ranking\\nprojects while starting new projects; MLTRL makes the veriﬁcation and validation (V&V) steps straightforward for\\nintegrating previously developed ML components.\\n21'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'random.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Evolving people, objectives, and measures\\nAs suggested earlier, much of the practical value of MLTRL comes at the transition between levels. More precisely,\\nMLTRL manages these oft neglected transitions explicitly as evolving teams, objectives, and deliverables. For instance,\\nthe team (or working group) at Level 3 is mostly AI Research Engineers, but at Level 6 is mixed Applied AI/SW\\nEngineers mixed with product managers and designers. Similarly, the review panels evolve from level to level, to match\\nthe changing technology development objectives. What the reviewers reference similarly evolves: notice in the level\\ndeﬁnitions that technical requirements and V&V guide early stages, but at and after Level 6 the product requirements\\nand V&V takeover – naturally, the risk quantiﬁcation and mitigation strategies evolve in parallel. Regarding the\\ndeliverables, notably TRL Cards and risk matrices[ 22] (to rank and prioritize various science, technical, and project\\nrisks), the information develops and evolves over time as the technology matures.\\nQuantiﬁable progress\\nBy deﬁning technology maturity in a quantitative way, MLTRL enables teams to accurately and consistently deﬁne\\ntheir ML progress metrics. Notably industry-standard “objectives and key results” (OKRs) and “key performance\\nindicators” (KPIs) [ 78] can be deﬁned as achieving certain readiness levels in a given period of time; this is a preferable\\nmetric in essentially all ML systems which consist of much more than a single performance score to measure progress.\\nEven more, meta-review of MLTRL progress over multiple projects can provide useful insights at the organization\\nlevel. For example, analysis of the time-per-level and the most frequent development paths/cycles can bring to light\\noperational bottlenecks. Compared to conventional software engineering metrics based on sprint stories and tickets, or\\ntime-tracking tools, MLTRL provides a more accurate analysis of ML workﬂows.\\nCommunication and explanation\\nA distinct advantage of MLTRL in practice is the nomenclature: an agreed upon grading scheme for the maturity of\\nan AI technology, and a framework for how/when that technology ﬁts within a product or system, enables everyone\\nto communicate effectively and transparently. MLTRL also acts as a gate for interpretability and explainability–at\\nthe granularity of individual models and algorithms, and more crucially from a holistic, systems standpoint. Notably\\nthe DARPA XAIxiprogram advocates for this advance in developing AI technologies; they suggest interpretability\\nand explainability are necessary at various locations in an AI system to be sufﬁcient for deployment as an AI product,\\notherwise leading to issues with ethics and bias.\\nRobustness via uncertainty-aware ML\\nHow to design a reliable system from unreliable components has been a guiding question in the ﬁelds of computing and\\nintelligence [79]. In the case of AI/ML systems, we aim to build reliable systems with myriad unreliable components:\\nnoisy and faulty sensors, human and AI error, and so on. There is thus signiﬁcant value to quantifying the myriad\\nuncertainties, propagating them throughout a system, and arriving at a notion or measure of reliability. For this reason,\\nalthough MLTRL applies generally to AI/ML methods and systems, we advocate for methods in the class of probabilistic\\nML, which naturally represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions[ 28]. These are Bayesian\\nmethods that use probabilities to represent aleatoric uncertainty , measuring the noise inherent in the observations, and\\nepistemic uncertainty , accounting for uncertainty in the model itself (i.e., capturing our ignorance about which model\\ngenerated the data). In the simplest case, an uncertainty aware ML pipeline should quantify uncertainty at the points of\\nsensor inputs or perception, prediction or model output, and decision or end-user action – McAllister et al.[ 29] suggest\\nthis with Bayesian deep learning models for safer autonomous vehicle pipelines. We can achieve this sufﬁciently well\\nin practice for simple systems. However, we do not yet have a principled, theoretically grounded, and generalizable way\\nof propagating errors and uncertainties downstream and throughout more complex AI systems – i.e., how to integrate\\ndifferent software, hardware, data, and human components while considering how errors and uncertainties propagate\\nthrough the system. This is an important direction of our future work.\\nReferences\\n[1]Peter Henderson, Riashat Islam, Philip Bachman, Joelle Pineau, Doina Precup, and David Meger.

Data-readiness is one class of many\\nexample issues teams face without MLTRL, as depicted in Fig. 2.\\n•Level 6 – We were re-using a well-understood model and deployment pipeline in this use-case, meaning our\\nprimary challenge was around data reliability. For the problem of recognizing and classifying trash, building a\\nreliable data source using only real data is almost impossible due to diversity, class imbalance, and annotation\\nchallenges. Therefore we chose to develop a synthetic data generator to create training data. At this MLTRL\\nlevel, we needed to ensure that the synthetic data generator created sufﬁciently diverse data and exposed the\\ncontrols needed to alter the data distribution in production. Therefore, we carefully exposed APIs using the\\nUnity Perception package, which allowed us to control lighting, camera parameters, target and non-target\\nobject placements and counts, and background textures. Additionally, we ensured that the object labeling\\nmatched the real-world annotator instructions and that output data formats matched real-world counterparts.\\nLastly, we established a set of statistical tests to compare synthetic and real-world data distributions. The\\nMLTRL checks ensured that we understood, and in this case, adequately designed our data sources to meet\\nin-production requirements.\\n•Level 7 – From the previous level’s R&D TRL cards and observations, we knew relatively early in produc-\\ntization that we would need to assume bias for the real data sources due to class imbalance and imperfect\\nannotations. Therefore we designed tests to monitor these in the deployed application. MLTRL imposes these\\ncritical deployment tests well ahead of deployment, where we can easily overlook ML-speciﬁc failure modes.\\n•Level 8 – As we suggested earlier, problems that stem from real-world data are near impossible to anticipate\\nand design for, implying the need for level 8 ﬂight-readiness preparations. Given that we were generating\\nsynthetic images (with structured domain randomization) to complement the real data, we created tests for\\ndifferent data distribution shifts at multiple points in the classiﬁcation pipeline. We also implemented thorough\\nshadow tests ahead of deployment to evaluate how susceptible the ML model(s) to performance regressions\\ncaused by data. Additionally, we also implemented these as CI/CD tests over various deployment scenarios (or\\nmobile device computing speciﬁcations). Without these fully covered, documented, and automated, it would\\nbe impossible to pass level 8 review and deploy the technology.\\n•Level 9 – Post-deployment, the monitoring tests prescribed at Levels 8 and 9 and the three main code quality\\ncheckpoints in the MLTRL process help surface hidden performance degradation problems, common with\\ncomplex pipelines of data ﬂows and various models. The switchbacks depicted in Fig. 2 are typical in CV\\nuse-cases. For instance, miscalibrations in models pre-trained on synthetic data and ﬁne-tuned on newer real\\ndata can be common yet difﬁcult to catch. However, the level 7 to 4 switchback is designed precisely for these\\nchallenges and product improvements.\\nAccelerating scientiﬁc discovery with massive particle physics simulators\\nComputational models and simulation are key to scientiﬁc advances at all scales, from particle physics, to material\\ndesign and drug discovery, to weather and climate science, and to cosmology[ 35]. Many simulators model the forward\\nevolution of a system (coinciding with the arrow of time), such as the interaction of elementary particles, diffusion of\\ngasses, folding of proteins, or evolution of the universe in the largest scale. The task of inference refers to ﬁnding initial\\nconditions or global parameters of such systems that can lead to some observed data representing the ﬁnal outcome\\nof a simulation. In probabilistic programming[ 36], this inference task is performed by deﬁning prior distributions\\nover any latent quantities of interest, and obtaining posterior distributions over these latent quantities conditioned\\non observed outcomes (for example, experimental data) using Bayes rule. This process, in effect, corresponds to\\ninverting the simulator such that we go from the outcomes towards the inputs that caused the outcomes.

Complicated logic such as this can mask ML model performance lags\\nand failures, and also emphasized the need for R&D-to-product hand off described in MLTRL. Additional emphasis is\\nplaced on ML tests that consider the mix of real-world data with user annotations (b, right) and synthetic data generated\\nby Unity AI’s Perception tool and structured domain randomization (b, left).\\ncomplement real-world data sources (Figure 4). This application exempliﬁes three important challenges in ML product\\ndevelopment that MLTRL helps overcome:\\n•Multiple and disparate data sources are common in deployed ML pipelines yet often ignored in R&D.\\nFor instance, upstream data providers can change formats unexpectedly, or a physical event could cause the\\ncustomer behavior to change. It is nearly impossible to anticipate and design for all potential problems with\\nreal-world data and deployment. This computer vision system implemented pipelines and extended test suites\\nto cover open-source benchmark data, real user data, and synthetic data.\\n•Hidden performance degradation can be challenging to detect and debug in ML systems because gradual\\nchanges in performance may not be immediately visible. Common reasons for this challenge are that the\\nML component may be one step in a series. Additionally, local/isolated changes to an ML component’s\\nperformance may not directly affect the observed downstream performance. We can see both issues in the\\nillustrated logic diagram for the automated recycling app (Figure 4). A slight degradation in the initial CV\\nmodel may not heavily inﬂuence the following user input. However, when an uncommon input image appears\\nin the future, the app fails altogether.\\n•Model usage requirements can make or break an ML product. For example, the Netﬂix “$1M Prize” solution\\nwas never fully deployed because of signiﬁcant engineering costs in real-world scenariosv. For example,\\nengineering teams must communicate memory usage, compute power requirements, hardware availability,\\nnetwork privacy, and latency to the ML teams. ML teams often only understand the statistics or ML theory\\nbehind a model but not the system requirements or how it scales.\\nWe next elucidate these challenges and how MLTRL helps overcome them in the context of this project’s lifecycle. This\\nproject started at level 4, using largely existing ML methods with a target use-case.\\n•Level 4 – For this project, we validated most of the components in other projects. Speciﬁcally, the computer\\nvision (CV) model for object recognition and classiﬁcation was an off-the-shelf model.

The project is as an interdisciplinary collaboration of specialists\\nin probabilistic machine learning, particle physics, and high-performance computing, all essential elements to achieve\\nthe project outcomes. Even more, it is a multi-year project spanning multiple countries, companies, university labs, and\\ngovernment research organizations, bringing signiﬁcant challenges in project management, technology coordination\\nand validation. Aided by MLTRL, there were several key challenges to overcome in this project that are common in\\nscientiﬁc-ML projects:\\n•Integrating with legacy systems is common in scientiﬁc and industrial use-cases, where ML methods are\\napplied with existing sensor networks, infrastructure, and codebases. In this case, particle physics domain\\nexperts at CERN are using the SHERPA simulator[ 38], a 1 million line codebase developed over the last\\ntwo decades. Rewriting the simulator for ML use-cases is infeasible due to the codebase size and buried\\ndomain knowledge, and new ML experts would need signiﬁcant onboarding to gain working knowledge of\\nthe codebase. It is also common to work with legacy data infrastructure, which can be poorly organized for\\nmachine learning (let alone preprocessed and clean) and unlikely to have followed best practices such as\\ndataset versioning.\\n•Coupling hardware and software architectures is non-trivial when deploying ML at scale, as performance\\nconstraints are often considered in deployment tests well after model and algorithm development, not to\\nmention the expertise is often split across disjoint teams. This can be exacerbated in scientiﬁc-ML when\\nscaling to supercomputing infrastructure, and working with massive datasets that can be in the terabytes and\\npetabytes.\\n•Interpretability is often a desired feature yet difﬁcult to deliver and validate in practice. Particularly in\\nscientiﬁc ML applications such as this, mechanisms and tooling for domain experts to interpret predictions\\nand models are key for usability (integrating in workﬂows and building trust).\\nTo this end, we will go through the MLTRL levels one by one, demonstrating how they ensure the above scientiﬁc ML\\nchallenges are diligently addressed.\\n•Level 0 – The theoretical developments leading to Etalumis are immense and well discussed in Baydin et\\nal [37]. In particular the ML theory and methods are in a relatively nascent area of ML and mathematics,\\nprobabilistic programming. New territory can present more challenges compared to well-traveled research\\npaths, for instance in computer vision with neural networks. It is thus helpful to have a guiding framework\\nwhen making a new path in ML research, such as MLTRL where early reviews help theoretical ML projects\\nget legs.\\n•Level 1-2 – Running low-level experiments in simple testbeds is generally straightforward when working\\nwith probabilistic programming and simulation; in a sense, this easy iteration over experiments is what\\nPPL are designed for. It was additionally helpful in this project to have rich data grounded in physical\\nconstraints, allowing us to better isolate model behaviors (rather than data assumptions and noise). The\\nMLTRL requirements documentation is particularly useful for the standard PPL experimentation workﬂow:\\nmodel, infer, criticize, repeat (or Box’s loop) [ 39]. The evaluation step (i.e. criticizing the model) can be\\nmore nuanced than checking summary statistics as in deep learning and similar ML workﬂows. It is thus a\\nuseful practice to write down the criticism methods, metrics, and expected results as veriﬁcations for speciﬁc\\nresearch requirements, rather than iterating over Box’s loop without a priori targets. Further, because this\\nresearch project had a speciﬁc target application early in the process (the SHERPA simulator), the project\\ntimeline beneﬁted from recognizing simulator-integration constraints upfront as requirements, not to mention\\ndata availability concerns, which are often overlooked in early R&D levels. It was additionally useful to have\\nCERN scientists as domain experts in the reviews at these R&D levels.\\n•Level 3 – Systems development can be challenging with probabilistic programming, again because it is\\nrelatively nascent and much of the out-of-the-box tools and infrastructure are not there as in most ML and\\ndeep learning. Here in particular there’s a novel (unproven) approach for systems integration: a probabilistic\\nprogramming execution protocol was developed to reroute random number draws in the stochastic simulator\\ncodebase (SHERPA) to the probabilistic programming system, thus enabling the system to control stochastic\\nchoices in SHERPA and run inference on its execution traces, all while keeping the legacy codebase intact! A\\nmore invasive method that modiﬁes SHERPA would not have been acceptable. If it were not for MLTRL forcing\\nsystems considerations this early in the Etalumis project lifecycle, this could have been an insurmountable\\nhurdle later when multiple codebases and infrastructures come into play. By the same token, systems planning\\nhere helped enable the signiﬁcant HPC scaling later: the team deﬁned the need for HPC support well ahead\\nof actually running HPC, in order to build the prototype code in a way that would readily map to HPC (in\\naddition to local or cloud CPU and GPU).

Note\\nthis is a subset of a full TRL Card, which in reality lives as a full document in an internal wiki. Notice the card\\nclearly communicates the data sources, versions, and assumptions. This helps mitigate invalid assumptions about\\nperformance and generalizability when moving from R&D to production, and promotes the use of real-world data\\nearlier in the project lifecycle. We recommend documenting datasets thoroughly with semantic versioning and tools\\nsuch as datasheets for datasets [24], and following data accountability best-practices as they evolve (see [25]).\\n•Costs of edge cases can be signiﬁcant, sometimes risking expensive machine downtime or medical failures.\\nThis is exacerbated in anomaly detection anomalies are by deﬁnition rare so they can be difﬁcult to train for,\\nespecially for the anomalies that are completely unseen until they arise in the wild.\\n•End-user trust can be difﬁcult to achieve, often preventing the adoption of ML applications, particularly in\\nthe healthcare domain and other highly regulated industries.\\nThese and additional ML challenges such as data privacy and interpretability can inhibit ML adoption in clinical practice\\nand industrial settings, but can be mitigated with MLTRL processes. We’ll describe how in the context of the Naud\\n& Lavin[ 23] example, which began at level 0 with theoretical ML work on manifold geometries, and at level 5 was\\ndirected towards specialized human-machine teaming applications utilizing the same ML method under-the-hood.\\n•Levels 0-1 – From open-ended exploration of data-representation properties in various Riemmanian manifold\\ncurvatures, we derived from ﬁrst principles and empirically identiﬁed a property with hyperbolic manifolds:\\nwhen used as a latent space for embedding data without labels, the geometry organizes the data by it’s implicit\\nhierarchical structure. Unsupervised computer vision was identiﬁed in reviews as a promising direction for\\nproof-of-principle work.\\n•Level 2 – One approach for validating the earlier theoretical developments was to generate synthetic data to\\nisolate very speciﬁc features in data we would expect represented in the latent manifold. The results showed\\npromise for anomaly detection – using the latent representation of data to automatically identify images that\\nare out-of-the-ordinary (anomalous), and also using the manifold to inspect how they are semantically different.\\nFurther, starting with an implicitly probabilistic modeling approach implied uncertainty estimation could be\\na valuable feature downstream. This made the level 2 key decision point clear: proceed with applied ML\\ndevelopment.\\n•Levels 3-5 – Proof-of-concept development and reviews demonstrated promise for several commercial appli-\\ncations relevant to the business, and also highlighted the need for several key features (deﬁned as R&D and\\nproduct requirements): interpretability (towards end-user trust), uncertainty quantiﬁcation (to show conﬁdence\\nscores), and human-in-the-loop (for domain expertise). Without the MLTRL PoC steps and review processes,\\nthese features can often be delayed until beta testing or overlooked completely – for example, the failures of\\napplying IBM Watson in medical applications [ 27].

Data-readiness is one class of many\\nexample issues teams face without MLTRL, as depicted in Fig. 2.\\n•Level 6 – We were re-using a well-understood model and deployment pipeline in this use-case, meaning our\\nprimary challenge was around data reliability. For the problem of recognizing and classifying trash, building a\\nreliable data source using only real data is almost impossible due to diversity, class imbalance, and annotation\\nchallenges. Therefore we chose to develop a synthetic data generator to create training data. At this MLTRL\\nlevel, we needed to ensure that the synthetic data generator created sufﬁciently diverse data and exposed the\\ncontrols needed to alter the data distribution in production. Therefore, we carefully exposed APIs using the\\nUnity Perception package, which allowed us to control lighting, camera parameters, target and non-target\\nobject placements and counts, and background textures. Additionally, we ensured that the object labeling\\nmatched the real-world annotator instructions and that output data formats matched real-world counterparts.\\nLastly, we established a set of statistical tests to compare synthetic and real-world data distributions. The\\nMLTRL checks ensured that we understood, and in this case, adequately designed our data sources to meet\\nin-production requirements.\\n•Level 7 – From the previous level’s R&D TRL cards and observations, we knew relatively early in produc-\\ntization that we would need to assume bias for the real data sources due to class imbalance and imperfect\\nannotations. Therefore we designed tests to monitor these in the deployed application. MLTRL imposes these\\ncritical deployment tests well ahead of deployment, where we can easily overlook ML-speciﬁc failure modes.\\n•Level 8 – As we suggested earlier, problems that stem from real-world data are near impossible to anticipate\\nand design for, implying the need for level 8 ﬂight-readiness preparations. Given that we were generating\\nsynthetic images (with structured domain randomization) to complement the real data, we created tests for\\ndifferent data distribution shifts at multiple points in the classiﬁcation pipeline. We also implemented thorough\\nshadow tests ahead of deployment to evaluate how susceptible the ML model(s) to performance regressions\\ncaused by data. Additionally, we also implemented these as CI/CD tests over various deployment scenarios (or\\nmobile device computing speciﬁcations). Without these fully covered, documented, and automated, it would\\nbe impossible to pass level 8 review and deploy the technology.\\n•Level 9 – Post-deployment, the monitoring tests prescribed at Levels 8 and 9 and the three main code quality\\ncheckpoints in the MLTRL process help surface hidden performance degradation problems, common with\\ncomplex pipelines of data ﬂows and various models. The switchbacks depicted in Fig. 2 are typical in CV\\nuse-cases. For instance, miscalibrations in models pre-trained on synthetic data and ﬁne-tuned on newer real\\ndata can be common yet difﬁcult to catch. However, the level 7 to 4 switchback is designed precisely for these\\nchallenges and product improvements.\\nAccelerating scientiﬁc discovery with massive particle physics simulators\\nComputational models and simulation are key to scientiﬁc advances at all scales, from particle physics, to material\\ndesign and drug discovery, to weather and climate science, and to cosmology[ 35]. Many simulators model the forward\\nevolution of a system (coinciding with the arrow of time), such as the interaction of elementary particles, diffusion of\\ngasses, folding of proteins, or evolution of the universe in the largest scale. The task of inference refers to ﬁnding initial\\nconditions or global parameters of such systems that can lead to some observed data representing the ﬁnal outcome\\nof a simulation. In probabilistic programming[ 36], this inference task is performed by deﬁning prior distributions\\nover any latent quantities of interest, and obtaining posterior distributions over these latent quantities conditioned\\non observed outcomes (for example, experimental data) using Bayes rule. This process, in effect, corresponds to\\ninverting the simulator such that we go from the outcomes towards the inputs that caused the outcomes. In the\\n“Etalumis” project[ 37] (“simulate” spelled backwards), we are using probabilistic programming methods to invert\\n12')],\n",
